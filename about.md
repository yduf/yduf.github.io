Hello! 
You have found my recreative site, where I track funny things, ideas and some of my personnal projects.

There probably nothing of interests here, except for me of course. This is not even a blog.
It begins as way to move my bookmarks from my browser to a shared place that can access from anywhere. It also allows me to give deeper on topics, joting notes around.

Yet, if you are interested on some of this, and want to get in touch, [Contact me](https://github.com/yduf).

Software Architect – Developer – Project Leader.
