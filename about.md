Hello! 

You have found my recreational place, where I track funny things, ideas, and some of my personal projects.

There's probably nothing of interest here, except for me, of course. This is not even a blog.
It begins as a way to move my bookmarks from my browser to a shared place that I can access from anywhere. It also allows me to delve deeper into topics, jotting notes as time goes by.

Yet, if you are interested on some of this, and want to get in touch, [Contact me](https://github.com/yduf).

Software Architect – Developer – Project Leader.
