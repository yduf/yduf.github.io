> Until the discovery of better coding techniques ([Turbo codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code) and [low-density parity codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code)), Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC) was one of the most powerful ways to make data storage or data transmission resilient against corruption - [Reed-Solomon Error Correcting Codes from the Bottom Up](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2022/08/07/Reed-Solomon.html)

- [Luhn algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm) -  a simple check digit formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers. Designed to protect against accidental errors, not malicious attacks. Most credit cards and many government identification numbers use the algorithm as a simple method of distinguishing valid numbers from mistyped or otherwise incorrect numbers.
