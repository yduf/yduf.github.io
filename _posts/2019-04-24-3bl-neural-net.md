> But what *is* a Neural Network? - [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) / [How Does a Neural Network Work in 60 seconds? ](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Dbcx2_MO0LM)

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: [https://goo.gl/Zmczdy](https://goo.gl/Zmczdy).

I also highly recommend [Chris Olah's blog](http://colah.github.io/)

For more videos, Welch Labs also has some great series on machine learning: (
- [Learning to see]({% post_url 2019-04-25-learning-to-see %})
- [Neural Networks Demystified](https://youtu.be/bxe2T-V8XRs)

For those of you looking to go *even* deeper, check out the text "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. Also, the publication [Distill](https://distill.pub/) is just utterly beautiful.
