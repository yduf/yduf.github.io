> Our key ideais to leverage a trained GAN to extract pixel-wise represen-tation  from  the  input  image  and  use  it  as  feature  vectorsfor a segmentation network. - [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/m4q2gk/p_oneshot_segmentation_with_pretrained_gan/) / [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.04379.pdf)
