> Rust hits more of these but it's ugly. Uglier than Python and approaches C++-level eyebleed. Rust generics aren't as flexible as they could be because type constraints don't have union and specialization is painful. Tag structs are laborious. Go hits more of these except it's not as flexible and not quite as safe as Rust. Rust makes enormous binaries and compiles slow and the cargo index download is glacial, I'm surprised they don't have an "sccache" for it. Go is easy to learn but then the capability of it plateaus. Go compiles and tests insanely fast. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34542798)

	- The issue is that code that the borrow checker flags is not code that is unsafe, but code that the borrow checker cannot prove safe. There is a difference.
Until, you natively start thinking and writing code with idioms that the borrow checker is tuned for, there will be friction.
