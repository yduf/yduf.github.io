> a classic greedy algorithm merging the breadth-first search approach with a heuristic evaluation function to prune nodes on each level of the
tree... 
> Beam Search is considered a good choice for
games that have limited interaction with the oppo-
nent(s), so the planning part is more important than
the exact opponent prediction - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_search)

At the cost of losing the optimality, the algorithm allows us to easily trade
branching factor for increased search depth â€“ thus gain an advantage on future planning.
