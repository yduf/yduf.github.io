Play under wine directly (badly support 2 monitor config - performance issue on start cinematique - run well though, when there is one only)

### Runaway 2: The Dream of the Turtle - 2006
[![caption](https://lutris.net/games/banner/runaway-2-the-dream-of-the-turtle.jpg)](https://lutris.net/games/runaway-2-the-dream-of-the-turtle/) Same as previously - play underwine directly / first video is shoppy on 2 screen, but after everything works fine.
