## List identity
Find and take a note of your public key fingerprint, to recognize which key belong to who.
{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh-add -l -E sha256
> 2048 SHA256:274ffWxgaxq/tSINAykStUL7XWyRNcRTlcST1Ei7gBQ /Users/USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)

## Copy ssh keys to another machine - [askubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/4830/easiest-way-to-copy-ssh-keys-to-another-machine/4833#4833)

{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/id_rsa.pub  root@10.11.99.1
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: ".ssh/id_rsa.pub"
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@10.11.99.1's password: 

Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@10.11.99.1'"
{% endhighlight %}

Alternative for key copied locally

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat <your_public_key_file> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

## [Changing SSH key passphrase](https://serverfault.com/questions/50775/how-do-i-change-my-private-key-passphrase/50778#50778)

{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh-keygen -p

## [Disable password access](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1991/disable-password-access-through-ssh)

If you want to fully disable password-based authentication, [set BOTH PasswordAuthentication and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'](https://superuser.com/questions/161609/can-someone-explain-the-passwordauthentication-in-the-etc-ssh-sshd-config-fil/374234#374234)...  since SSH is a network-based protocol, the server has no way to guarantee that responses to ChallengeResponseAuthentication (a.k.a. 'keyboard-interactive') are actually being provided by a user sitting at a keyboard so long as the challenge(s) always and only consists of asking a user for her password.

{% highlight bash %}
# Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswordAuthentication no
ChallengeResponseAuthentication: no

$ sudo systemctl restart sshd
{% endhighlight %}

### [Test that it works](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/15138/how-to-force-ssh-client-to-use-only-password-auth/15141#15141)
{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no example.com

=> yves@192.168.0.x: Permission denied (publickey).
{% endhighlight %}

## [Keep SSH session](https://medium.com/@grassfedcode/what-could-be-better-than-ssh-e69561ec1b83)

## [Enable SSH server](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/service-openssh)

{% highlight bash %}
sudo apt install openssh-server

## [Generating a new ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

Use **one key** per origin host, no need to change the default file.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C `hostname`
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/yves/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in github_rsa
Your public key has been saved in github_rsa.pub
{% endhighlight %}
