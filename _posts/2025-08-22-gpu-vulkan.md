> Vulkan is a cross-platform, open standard set of APIs that allows programs to use GPU hardware in various ways, from drawing on screen, to doing calculations, to decoding video via custom hardware accelerators. Rather than using a custom hardware accelerator present, these codecs are based on compute shaders, and work on any implementation of Vulkan 1.3.
Decoders use the same hwaccel API and commands, so users do not need to do anything special to enable them, as enabling Vulkan decoding is sufficient to use them. - [ffmpeg 8.0](https://ffmpeg.org/index.html#pr8.0) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44985730)
