> Cryptography folklore has it that simple substitution ciphers are trivial to break by looking at the letter frequencies of the encrypted text. - [Verifying the Substitution Cipher Folklore](https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20160318/)

### [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)

Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

### [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13)

ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the Latin alphabet.
