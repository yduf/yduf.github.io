> the Kolmogorov complexity of an object, such as a piece of text, is the length of a shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output. It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity)
