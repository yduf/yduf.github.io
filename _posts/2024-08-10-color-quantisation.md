- [nQuantGpp](https://github.com/mcychan/nQuantGpp?tab=readme-ov-file#nquantgpp) - nQuantGpp includes top 10 color quantization algorithms for g++ producing high quality optimized images. nQuantGpp is ported from nQuantCpp which migrates to OpenCV to leverage the deep learning features of such popular library.
	- [nQuantCpp](https://github.com/mcychan/nQuantCpp?tab=readme-ov-file#nquantcpp) -  includes top 6 color quantization algorithms f
    	- [ Linux #7 ](https://github.com/mcychan/nQuantCpp/issues/7) - it once compiled on Linux, but currently it does not because it depends on GdiPlus.
