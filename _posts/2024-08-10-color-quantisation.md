> *Color quantization* is primarily used in computer graphics research literature; in applications, terms such as optimized palette generation, optimal palette generation, or decreasing color depth are used. Some of these are misleading, as the palettes generated by standard algorithms are not necessarily the best possible. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_quantization)

- [nQuantGpp](https://github.com/mcychan/nQuantGpp?tab=readme-ov-file#nquantgpp) - nQuantGpp includes top 10 color quantization algorithms for g++ producing high quality optimized images. nQuantGpp is ported from nQuantCpp which migrates to OpenCV to leverage the deep learning features of such popular library.
	- [nQuantCpp](https://github.com/mcychan/nQuantCpp?tab=readme-ov-file#nquantcpp) -  includes top 6 color quantization algorithms f
