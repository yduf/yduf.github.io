> PipeWire has a better vibe than Pulseaudio did. It intends to replace a system that never worked flawlessly, seems to focus on compatibility, and the apparent endorsement from the [JACK]({% post_url 2017-06-09-Linux-Audio %})-developers also does not hurt. - [PipeWire Overview](https://docs.pipewire.org/page_overview.html) / [lwn](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/847412/d7826b1353e33734/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26329027)

### [How to Use PipeWire to replace PulseAudio in Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/04/pipewire-replace-pulseaudio-ubuntu-2204/)

Pipewire is pre-installed out-of-the-box, and runs as background service automatically. ([Ubuntu 22.10 Makes PipeWire Default for Audio][https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/05/ubuntu-22-10-makes-pipewire-default])

You may check it out by running command below in terminal:

{% highlight bash %}
systemctl --user status pipewire pipewire-session-manager
{% endhighlight %}

Though available out-of-the-box, itâ€™s not in use by default for audio output.

So need to [follow this ](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2022/04/pipewire-replace-pulseaudio-ubuntu-2204/)

{% highlight bash %}
# install 
sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries libspa-0.2-bluetooth libspa-0.2-jack
sudo apt install wireplumber pipewire-media-session-

# switch config
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/alsa.conf.d/99-pipewire-default.conf /etc/alsa/conf.d/
sudo cp /usr/share/doc/pipewire/examples/ld.so.conf.d/pipewire-jack-*.conf /etc/ld.so.conf.d/
sudo ldconfig

sudo apt remove pulseaudio-module-bluetooth

# enable  media session 
systemctl --user --now enable wireplumber.service
{% endhighlight %}

Need to restart... (why?)

{% highlight bash %}
# check with 
$ pactl info
Server Name: PulseAudio (on PipeWire 0.3.48) # <= this validates the change + sound should be working
{% endhighlight %}
