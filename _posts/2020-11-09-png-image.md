> PNG is a raster-graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)

PNG supports palette-based images, and full-color non-palette-based RGB or RGBA images.

## [Optimizing tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics#Optimizing_tools)

Before zopflipng was available, a good way in practice to perform a png optimization is to use a combination of 2 tools in sequence for optimal compression: one which optimizes filters (and removes ancillary chunks), and one which optimizes DEFLATE. Although pngout offers both, only one type of filter can be specified in a single run, therefore it can be used with a wrapper tool or in combination with optipng or pngcrush, acting as a re-deflater, like advdef.
