> A potential field is a type of scalar field. In contrast, a flow field is a vector field. These are essentially just multidimensional arrays that are used as low level data structures for various pathfinding designs; there really is no "standard" algorithm equivalent to the ubiquity of A* for point-to-point pathfinding. - [How are flow fields different from potential fields?](https://gamedev.stackexchange.com/questions/83949/how-are-flow-fields-different-from-potential-fields)
