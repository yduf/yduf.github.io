**Free version** - Free to download and use.
It has some limitations on used export resolutions, available plugins and some of the more advanced features (noise reduction, effects, audio and video encoders/decoders, interlaced video handling, GPU usage). For many uses and users this version does pretty much everything you might need for video editing. Does not utilize a GPU as much as the paid Studio version.
