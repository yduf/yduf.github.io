> The Raspberry Pi and its HQ camera make a surprisingly potent webcam, and if you want to cover the basics, and rival the image quality of all but the highest-end dedicated webcams, you can do it for under $100. - [Jeff Geerling](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-makes-great-usb-webcam-100) 

- [Show-me webcam](https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam) - This firmware transforms your Raspberry Pi into a high quality webcam. It works reliably, boots quickly, and gets out of your way.

- [a Remote Raspberry Pi Desktop/Camera/Server](https://www.instructables.com/Pi-Cam-a-Remote-Raspberry-Pi-DesktopCameraServer/) - I made this 3D Printed Camera, it's not just a camera but a full Linux Desktop based on Raspberry Pi 4 and has 8GB RAM, 12MP camera with a 16mm Telephoto Lens. The images that came out of it are great.
