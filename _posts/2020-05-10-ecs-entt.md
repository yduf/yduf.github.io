> [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) is a header-only, tiny and easy to use library for game programming and much more written in modern C++, mainly known for its innovative entity-component-system (ECS) model.
Among others, it's used in Minecraft by Mojang and the ArcGIS Runtime SDKs by Esri. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23128702)

## [Why should I use an ECS?](https://skypjack.github.io/2019-02-14-ecs-baf-part-1/)
The main reason why you should use such a tool is the code organization and not (only) the performance. Of course, performance matter, but a well organized codebase is invaluable sometimes and for a lot of games you wonâ€™t have performance problem even with OOP or suboptimal implementations of component based models.
In fact, component based programming is an incredibly powerful tool to make code flexible and to speed up iterations during development. This must be your first goal, nothing else.
