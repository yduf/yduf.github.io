[Model Samsung LE32B652T4W](https://chatgpt.com/share/694ffd4e-cf58-800d-9143-614c40ab3d92)
- LCD panel: AUO T315HW02 V.3 (31.5″ FHD) with CCFL lamps (cold-cathode fluorescent backlight tubes), not LEDs.
	- **Note**: CCFL backlights are driven by an inverter inside the power supply (different from LED strips).

# [Diagnosis](https://chatgpt.com/share/694ffd4e-cf58-800d-9143-614c40ab3d92)

- TV has power
	- red light showing
    - play sound when powered
- screen is black
- when lighten with a power light we can see some faint text (and see menu) that disapears when powered off

Likely fault: backlight

## Backlight

### CCFL backlight
This TV does not use LED backlight strips — it uses CCFL lamps driven by an inverter circuit inside the PSU.

So instead of LED backlight strips, you’ll be diagnosing:

✅ CCFL backlight lamps

These are fluorescent tubes inside the panel that light up the LCD.

✅ Backlight inverter

In this model the inverter circuitry is part of the power supply board (BN44-00261A).

CCFL backlight inverter uses high voltage (hundreds of volts). If you’re not experienced with mains electricity, please get professional help.

CCFL inverters generate 600–1,500 V AC.
Do not touch lamp outputs when powered.

### Next step

What to check

Power on the TV

Open the back cover

On the power supply board (BN44-00261A), find the backlight inverter output lines to the CCFL lamps.

📌 Often marked something like:

INV / CCFL / Backlight Enable

Tubes usually connect via white multi-pin connectors

What measured voltage should look like

You should see high AC voltage on the CCFL lamp outputs when the TV is turned on.

If this voltage is missing → inverter is dead.

### Check inverter enable signal (easy + safe)
On the power supply board (BN44-00261A) locate the connector from the main board.

Look for pins labeled similar to:

BL_ON

INV_ON

DIM

Measure with multimeter (DC volts)

TV ON

Measure BL_ON → should be ~3–5 V

### Inspect inverter section visually (very common failure)

Focus on the inverter area of the PSU:

Check for:

🔥 Burnt or cracked inverter transformers

💥 Swollen electrolytic capacitors

🔩 Cracked solder joints (especially transformer pins)

⚡ Burnt MOSFETs (near transformers)

📌 Cold solder joints on inverter transformers are extremely common on Samsung B-series TVs

👉 Re-soldering transformer pins often fixes the TV completely.

### Option A — Repair inverter (recommended first)

Cheapest
✔ No panel disassembly

Typical fixes:

Replace bad electrolytic capacitors

Replace inverter MOSFETs

Re-solder inverter transformers

Replace defective transformer

📌 Success rate: very high
