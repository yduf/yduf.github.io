## [Diagnosis](https://chatgpt.com/share/694ffd4e-cf58-800d-9143-614c40ab3d92)

- TV has power
	- red light showing
    - play sound when powered
- screen is black
- when lighten with a power light we can see some faint text (and see menu) that disapears when powered off

Likely fault: Led Backlight
