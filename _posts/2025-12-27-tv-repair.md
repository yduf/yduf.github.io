[Model Samsung LE32B652T4W](https://chatgpt.com/share/694ffd4e-cf58-800d-9143-614c40ab3d92)
- LCD panel: AUO T315HW02 V.3 (31.5″ FHD) with CCFL lamps (cold-cathode fluorescent backlight tubes), not LEDs.
	- **Note**: CCFL backlights are driven by an inverter inside the power supply (different from LED strips).

## [Diagnosis](https://chatgpt.com/share/694ffd4e-cf58-800d-9143-614c40ab3d92)

- TV has power
	- red light showing
    - play sound when powered
- screen is black
- when lighten with a power light we can see some faint text (and see menu) that disapears when powered off

Likely fault: backlight

### backlight

This TV does not use LED backlight strips — it uses CCFL lamps driven by an inverter circuit inside the PSU.

So instead of LED backlight strips, you’ll be diagnosing:

✅ CCFL backlight lamps

These are fluorescent tubes inside the panel that light up the LCD.

✅ Backlight inverter

In this model the inverter circuitry is part of the power supply board (BN44-00261A).

CCFL backlight inverter uses high voltage (hundreds of volts). If you’re not experienced with mains electricity, please get professional help.
