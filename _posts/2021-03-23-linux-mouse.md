title: How do mouse events work in linux?

> _evdev_ is the generic input event interface. It passes the events generated in the kernel straight to the program, with timestamps...This should be the way for GPM and X to get keyboard and mouse events. It allows for multihead in X without any specific multihead kernel support. The event codes are the same on all architectures and are hardware independent. - [SE](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/25601/how-do-mouse-events-work-in-linux) / [input/input.txt](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/input/input.txt)

> You can use blocking and nonblocking reads, and also select() on the /dev/input/eventX devices, and youâ€™ll always get a whole number of input events on a read. - [Event interface](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.14/input/input.html#event-interface) / [Input event codes](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/input/event-codes.html#input-event-codes)
