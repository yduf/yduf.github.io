> [Comanche uses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comanche_(video_game_series)) a technique called [Voxel Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel_Space), which is based on the same ideas like ray casting. Hence the Voxel Space engine is a 2.5D engine, it doesn't have all the levels of freedom that a regular 3D engine offers. - [tutorial](https://github.com/s-macke/VoxelSpace) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15772065)
