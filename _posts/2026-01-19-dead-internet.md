> We have reached the Dead Internet, i.e. most interactions are between bots, and most content is machine generated to either sell you stuff, or game the SEO game (in order to sell you stuff). - [ Dead Internet Theory ](https://kudmitry.com/articles/dead-internet-theory/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46671731)

- We have social networks like Facebook that require people to be angry, because anger generates engagement, and engagement generates views, and views generate ad impressions. We have outside actors who benefit from division, so they also fuel that fire by creating bot accounts that post inciting content. This has nothing to do with racism or people on one side. One second, these outside actors post a fake incident of a racist cop to fire up one side, and the next, they post a fake incident about schools with litter boxes for kids who identify as pets to fire up the other side. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46676777)
