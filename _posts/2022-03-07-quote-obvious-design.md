> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. - [C.A.R. Hoare, The 1980 ACM Turing Award Lecture](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP4610/hoare.pdf)
