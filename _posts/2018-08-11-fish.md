[Tips:](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27183766) set fish as your terminal's shell instead of changing your login shell.

[**bind**](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/bind.html) - key binding

## [The Fish Cookbook](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/cookbook.fish)
### [Set as default shell](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/faq.html#faq-default)
{% highlight bash %}
chsh -s /usr/bin/fish
{% endhighlight %}

Check that fish is allowed in [`/etc/shells`](https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/5.1/postlfs/etcshells.html)

### [PATH](https://jeffmcneill.com/path-bash-shell-fish-shell/)
PATH can be a pain, but there are some basics:
Where is PATH set
- **All** apps+shells /etc/environment
- **All shells** ~/.profile or /etc/profile for all users (or a separate file under /etc/profile.d/ if using pacman)
	- [re-use '~/.profile` for Fish?](https://superuser.com/questions/446925/re-use-profile-for-fish)
- Bash shell ~/.bashrc (or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login)
- Fish shell ~/.config/fish/config.fish
	- [fish_add_path](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/cmds/fish_add_path.html) - add to the path

## Alternative
- [murex](https://murex.rocks/) - murex supports multiple data types natively; such as JSON, YAML, CSV, S-Expressions and even loosely tabulated terminal output
- [elvish](https://elv.sh/) - Pipelines in Elvish can carry structured data, not just text.
