> The Kickstarter campaign didn’t just earn those $375k they asked for, it went two thirds overboard. This meant that in February 2015 David Fox could join to reunite the [Maniac Mansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maniac_Mansion) trio. Three months later Mark also became available for full-time work and with the extra funds in the bank Gary got his #1 player pick to work on the game’s backgrounds. - [Points & Click like it is 1990](https://thimbleweedpark.com/)
