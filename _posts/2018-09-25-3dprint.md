### First layer
[**Lines are overly visible or spaced apart on the first layer **](https://support.3dverkstan.se/article/23-a-visual-ultimaker-troubleshooting-guide#bottomlayer)

If the bottom layer of your print is showing very obvious print lines it's likely that your bed is simply levelled a little bit too far away from the nozzle.

### Infill
[**Infill is Visible from the Outside**](https://all3dp.com/1/common-3d-printing-problems-troubleshooting-3d-printer-issues/#infill-is-visible-from-the-outside)

The final print looks fine but an outline of the internal support structure can be seen through the walls of the print.
- Make sure that the value you have selected for the shell thickness is a multiple of the nozzle size.
- In Cura open up the ‘Expert Settings’ and under the Infill section tick the box next to ‘Infill prints after perimeters’, in latest version it's 'Infill before Walls' and it is not selected.
