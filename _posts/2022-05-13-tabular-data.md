**ndjson** -- [every line is a json object](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31256664)

**xlsx** -- Works in excel, ubiquitous format with a standard, however complicated and missing scientific features

**sqlite** -- Designed for relational data, somewhat ubiquitous, types defined but not enforced

**parquet** / **hdf5** / **apache feather** / etc -- Designed for scientific use cases, robust, efficient, less ubiquitous
	- [DuckDB](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31220841) is a lightweight and super fast library/CLI for working with Parquet. Itâ€™s SQLite for column formats
    - Arrow also has its own on-disk format called [Feather](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/feather.html)

**capn proto**, **prototype buffers**, **avro**, **thrift** -- Has specific features for data communication between systems
