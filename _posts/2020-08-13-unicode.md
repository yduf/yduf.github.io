### [UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 ?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/496321/utf-8-utf-16-and-utf-32)

- [Stick to UTF-8 and these three character sets](http://www.ilikebigbits.com/2016_10_12_character_sets.html) - coding policy for software devlopment

**UTF-8** has an advantage in the case where ASCII characters represent the majority of characters in a block of text, because UTF-8 encodes these into 8 bits (like ASCII). It is also advantageous in that a UTF-8 file containing only ASCII characters has the same encoding as an ASCII file.

**UTF-16** is better where ASCII is not predominant, since it uses 2 bytes per character, primarily. UTF-8 will start to use 3 or more bytes for the higher order characters where UTF-16 remains at just 2 bytes for most characters.

**UTF-32** will cover all possible characters in 4 bytes. This makes it pretty bloated. I can't think of any advantage to using it.
