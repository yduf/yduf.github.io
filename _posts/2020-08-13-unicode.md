## Binary Encoding

> To encode one additional bit per code point, we need to double the number of code points we use from 65,536 to 131,072. This would be a new encoding, Base131072, and its UTF-32 encoding efficiency would be 53% vs. 50% for Base65536. (Note that in UTF-16, Base32768 significantly outperforms either choice, and **in UTF-8, Base64 remains the preferred choice.**) - [Base efficiency](https://github.com/qntm/base65536)

- [Base2048](https://github.com/qntm/base2048) - Base2048 is a binary encoding optimised for transmitting data through Twitter.

Base2048 sadly renders Base65536 obsolete for its original intended purpose of sending binary data through Twitter. Using Base2048, up to 385 octets can fit in a single Tweet. Compare with Base65536, which manages only 280 octets.

However, Base65536 remains the state of the art for sending binary data through text-based systems which naively counts Unicode code points, particularly those using the fixed-width UTF-32 encoding.

- [Base32768](https://prose.io/#yduf/yduf.github.io/edit/master/_posts/2020-08-13-unicode.md)

Base32768 is a binary encoding optimised for UTF-16-encoded text.

- [Base65536](https://github.com/qntm/base65536) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14468818) - Base65536 is a binary encoding optimised for UTF-32-encoded text.

    - [Base65536: The (not very serious) Successor of Base64](https://www.isticktoit.net/?p=1504)

Base65536 encodes data in a similar fashion to base64, but its alphabet, instead of being 64 characters long, is 65536 characters long. This means, one can map 16 bits of data into a single unicode codepoint.
It is of course terribly inefficient, if you were to count the outputted bytes (especially when UTF-8 encoded), but if you count just the number of unicode characters, as for example Twitter does for it’s length limit, you can fit double the data per character.
