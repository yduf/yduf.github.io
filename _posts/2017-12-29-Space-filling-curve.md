> [**Peano curve (1890)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_curve) the first example of a space-filling curve to be discovered.

[**Hilbert curve (1891)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) gives a mapping between 1D and 2D space that fairly well preserves locality.[3] If (x,y) are the coordinates of a point within the unit square, and d is the distance along the curve when it reaches that point, then points that have nearby d values will also have nearby (x,y) values. The converse can't always be true. There will sometimes be points where the (x,y) coordinates are close but their d values are far apart.

[**Z-order curve (1966)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-order_curve). The z-value of a point in multidimensions is simply calculated by [interleaving the binary]({% post_url 2017-12-30-bit-interleave %}) representations of its coordinate values. Once the data are sorted into this ordering, any one-dimensional data structure can be used such as binary search trees, B-trees, skip lists or (with low significant bits truncated) hash tables. The resulting ordering can equivalently be described as the order one would get from a depth-first traversal of a quadtree.

As an alternative, the Hilbert curve has been suggested as it has a better order-preserving behaviour, but here the calculations are much more complicated, leading to significant processor overhead.
