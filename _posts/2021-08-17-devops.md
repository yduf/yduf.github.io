> - **DevOps**: Hired to do everything not involved in the feature development of main business. Range varies from Terraform to maintaining Jira, GSuite, Jenkins, ETL, BizOps. Maintains scripts and hacks everywhere.  
> - **SRE**: Orders teams to define SLOs, focuses only after incident procedures, not before. Insists on creating dashboards and putting them on TVs (when we had offices). Most eventually become vendor fans.  
> - **Platform**: We made this, we know better than you, you cannot use anything else. If you need new thing/improvement, create a ticket we will get back to you in 6 months to say we cannot do it due to other company wide very important initatives.
