> Guitarix is a virtual guitar amplifier for Linux running on [Jack Audio Connection Kit]({% post_url 2017-06-09-Linux-Audio %}). - [Home](https://guitarix.org/)

## [Getting Started With Guitarix](https://linuxaudio.github.io/libremusicproduction/html/articles/ultimate-guide-getting-started-guitarix.html)

**Note** that Guitarix is broken up into two JACK modules. The first one is called gx_head_amp, which is a mono module containing the amp and mono rack effects. The second is a stereo module for stereo rack effects. If these are not correctly connected up, make sure the output of the amp is going into the input of the stereo effects section.
