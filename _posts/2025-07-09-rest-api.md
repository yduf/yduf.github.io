> When I see "REST API" I can safely assume the following:
> - The API returns JSON
> - CRUD actions are mapped to POST/GET/PUT/DELETE
> - The team constantly bikesheds over correct status codes and at least a few are used contrary to the HTTP spec
> - There's a decent chance listing endpoints were changed to POST to support complex filters
> 
> Like Agile, CI or DevOps you can insist on the original definition or submit to the semantic diffusion and use the terms as they are commonly understood. - [Most RESTful APIs aren't really RESTful](https://florian-kraemer.net//software-architecture/2025/07/07/Most-RESTful-APIs-are-not-really-RESTful.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44507911)
