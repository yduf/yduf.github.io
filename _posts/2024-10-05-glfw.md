>  an Open Source, multi-platform library for OpenGL, OpenGL ES and Vulkan development on the desktop. It provides a simple API for creating windows, contexts and surfaces, receiving input and events. - [Home](https://www.glfw.org/)

It is similar to LibSDL, but is more lightweight and GPU-centric. GLFW is designed more with greenfield projects in mind, whereas LibSDL was designed from the beginning to help with porting existing code. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19673547)
- Notably it is missing any kind of audio support, but you probably want to ues FMOD, Wwise, or iirKlang anyway.
- SDL is all of that, plus various utilities for porting and some platform abstractions that are no longer needed. For example, logging, assertions, blitting, endian conversion, file abstraction, threads and atomics. There are a few associated helper libraries designed to work with SDL, like SDL_image, SDL_ttf, and SDL_mixer. These are optional.
- SFML is all of that, plus the interface is written in C++, there's all sorts of things like sprite drawing, texture loading, and audio systems mixed in, plus a bunch of extra random functionality like HTTP clients, OpenGL wrappers, etc.

## Setup

available as [meson wrap](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrapdb-projects.html)

or in ubuntu

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Can be easily used with [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started#example-if-you-are-using-glfw--openglwebgl)
