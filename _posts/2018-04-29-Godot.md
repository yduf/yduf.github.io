## [Why we choose Godot Engine](https://medium.com/@rockmilkgames/why-godot-engine-e0d4736d6eb0)
Now is the best moment to create a game. The first reason is that you are alive, after death you just can't make games anymore. The second reason is that the access to developing tools has never been so democratic.

Godot's Engine is a Godot Game itself.
