There's more than one way to walk a stack. ([see article](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2024-03-17/the-return-of-the-frame-pointers.html))

### Notes

The claim that hardware provided stack based CALL and RETURN instructions was not universally true. Many systems had no call/return stack, or supported only a single level of subroutine calls (essentially useless for a high level language but maybe useful for some hand written machine code). - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45501379)

- [Modern C/C++ on the Venerable 6502](https://youtu.be/ejbTKtgSZI0?si=9BzMRistNjhMw5_c&t=1353) - Most of ASM code on 6502 was more efficient by avoiding using a stack at all.
