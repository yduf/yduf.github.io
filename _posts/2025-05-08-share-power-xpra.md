> persistent remote display server and client for forwarding applications and desktop screens. - [Home](https://xpra.org/index.html)

Xpra differs from standard X forwarding primarily in allowing disconnection and reconnection without disrupting the forwarded application. It also differs from VNC and similar remote display technologies in being rootless, so applications forwarded by Xpra appear on the local desktop as normal windows managed by the local window manager, rather than being all "trapped in a box together". - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpra)
