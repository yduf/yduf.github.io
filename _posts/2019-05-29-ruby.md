- [**using Rbenv**](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-ruby-on-ubuntu-20-04/#installing-ruby-using-rbenv) - [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) does things on the fly by using shims to execute commands.
	- a directory of shims (~/.rbenv/shims) is inserted to the front of PATH.
    - The directory holds a shim for every Ruby command.
    - The operating system searches for a shim that matches the name of the command, which in turn passes it to rbenv, determining the Ruby version to execute.
    - rbenv-gemsets is the rbenv equivalent of gemsets
    
Latest can be installed with [rbenv installer](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer#rbenv-installer--doctor-scripts)
{% highlight bash %}
$ rbenv init            # Set up rbenv in your shell.

$ rbenv install -l      # list of all Ruby versions that can be installed 
$ rbenv install 2.7.1	# install Ruby version 2.7.1
{% endhighlight %}


- [**using RVM**](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-ruby-on-ubuntu-20-04/#installing-ruby-using-rvm)
	- RVM overrides the cd shell command in order to load the current Ruby environment variables.
    - RVM comes with its own Ruby installation mechanism
