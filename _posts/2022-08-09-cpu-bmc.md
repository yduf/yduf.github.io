“Knowing where the chips go is probably a very good thing. You could for example, on every chip put in essentially a public private key pair, which authenticates it and allows it to work”.

What he won’t tell is that this is already a reality, as I learned after having my [air-gapped system](https://www.howtogeek.com/687792/the-ultimate-defense-what-is-an-air-gapped-computer/) and Pixel phone wiped remotely for doing academic research on wireless “silent speech interfaces”.

Anyone doing research on this area be cautious of sabotage when using US designed CPUs (AMD/INTEL/QUALCOMM/APPLE/ARM), as the microcode, SMM and firmware of your system may be manipulated to mess up your computations. Ask your own Nation to stop trusting Silicon Valley and make your own silicon supply chain and tech services.
