> Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a straight line between two points. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26777800) / [pdf](http://members.chello.at/%7Eeasyfilter/Bresenham.pdf)

- [Midpoint circle algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_circle_algorithm) - Bresenham's circle algorithm is derived from the midpoint circle algorithm.
