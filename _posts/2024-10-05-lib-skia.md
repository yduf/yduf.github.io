> Skia does one thing really well, 2D graphics.  
> The original “Skia” was the development name for QuickDraw GX.  This Skia—which, again, doesn’t share code with either of its predecessors—is a kind of version 3, with a tribute name back to that original Skia. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16146869) / [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine)

	-  It is far not that trivial to integrate Skia with existing 3D OpenGL code. Even Skia can work with OpenGL backend it changes state of OpenGL device and that creates problems.

### Setup
- [Introducing to SKIA with C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEj_GfH8is8&t=78s)

Skia doesn't seems to be already available as binary and you need to compile it yourself.

One way is to use [chromium depot_tools](https://chatgpt.com/share/6701ad96-a488-800d-a7de-7286358d807d)

Procedure doesn't install `gn` tools, one easy way is to build it directly.
see [gn](https://gn.googlesource.com/gn).

Here is a a detail procedure

**Install Depot Tools**
{% highlight bash %}
# Clone Depot Tools
$ git clone https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/tools/depot_tools.git

# Set Environment Variables
$ export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/depot_tools"
{% endhighlight %}

**Build gn binary**
May require clang to be installed
{% highlight bash %}
$ git clone https://gn.googlesource.com/gn
$ cd gn
$ python build/gen.py # --allow-warning if you want to build with warnings.
$ ninja -C out
# To run tests:
$ out/gn_unittests
{% endhighlight %}

**Build skia**
{% highlight bash %}
# go back to your project directory
# Fetch Skia Source Code
$ gclient config --name=skia https://skia.googlesource.com/skia.git
$ gclient sync

# link gn where it belongs
$ mkdir -p skia/buildtools/linux64
$ cd skia/buildtools/linux64
$ ln -s <path to gn>/out/gn .
$ cd -

# The next command may failed silently when gn is not present: normal output is build.ninja file
$ gn gen out/Release --args='is_debug=false'
  
# if everything is ok, you now have a build.ninja
# launch compile and go for a coffee
$ ninja -C out/Release skia 
{% endhighlight %}
