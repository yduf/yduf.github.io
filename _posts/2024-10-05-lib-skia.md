> The original “Skia” was the development name for QuickDraw GX.  This Skia—which, again, doesn’t share code with either of its predecessors—is a kind of version 3, with a tribute name back to that original Skia. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16146869) / [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skia_Graphics_Engine)

	-  It is far not that trivial to integrate Skia with existing 3D OpenGL code. Even Skia can work with OpenGL backend it changes state of OpenGL device and that creates problems.


### Setup
- [Introducing to SKIA with C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEj_GfH8is8&t=78s)

Skia doesn't seems to be already available as binary and you need to compile it yourself.

One way is to use [chromium depot_tools](https://chatgpt.com/share/6701ad96-a488-800d-a7de-7286358d807d)
