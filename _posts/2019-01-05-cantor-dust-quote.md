- [	Georg Cantor and His Heritage](http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0209244) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39727610) - $Z$ and $Q$ are countable and $R$ is uncountable
	- Turing extended to the computable numbers K, which can be conceptualized as a number where you can write a f(n) that returns the nth digit in a number.
    - The reals numbers are un-computable almost everywhere, this property holds for all real numbers in a set except a subset of measure zero, the computable reals K which is Aleph Zero, a countable infinity.
	- The set of computable reals is only as big as N, and can be mapped to N.
