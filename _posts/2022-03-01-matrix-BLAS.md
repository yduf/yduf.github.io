> A common misconception is that BLAS implementations of matrix multiplication are orders of magnitude faster than naive implementations because they are very complex. - [BLAS-level CPU Performance in 100 Lines of C](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/shadjis/blas.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30509893) / [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1303182/how-does-blas-get-such-extreme-performance/11421344#11421344)

Due to optimisations similar to those in this article. The asymptotically faster algorithms are not useful in practice.
