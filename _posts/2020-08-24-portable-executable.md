> One day, while studying old code, I found out that it's possible to encode Windows Portable Executable files as a UNIX Sixth Edition shell script, due to the fact that the Thompson Shell didn't use a shebang line. - [αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε](https://justine.storage.googleapis.com/ape.html) - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24256883)

> Back when all you had was minicom dialing a BBS, there was a chicken and egg problem where you needed uudecode to decode any executable you downloaded. If you did not have uudecode you were stuck. If you are unfamiliar, unencoding a file allows you to send binary data through text transmission.
> 
> Then a clever version of a DOS .COM file was posted which implemented uudecode, but it only used x86 instructions that were also ASCII characters. You could copy/paste between the --cut here-- lines into a file, save it as uudecode.com, and then get your other binaries like pkzip. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24257421)
