## [OpenWrt in Docker](https://github.com/oofnikj/docker-openwrt) / [contain your router](https://badgateway.qc.to/contain-your-router/)

This [should work on raspberry](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/running-openwrt-in-a-docker-container/56049), and allows to use module compiled for the linkux kernel (which are harder to include for OpenWrt).

### [Teleport the Wi-Fi](https://badgateway.qc.to/contain-your-router/)
Containers are isolated from the host in several ways. They have their own PID namespace, their own user namespace, and their own network namespace. But since containers are all running atop the host kernel, we can expose various resources from the host to the container, like network interfaces, by moving them from the primary namespace to that of the container.

Docker provides a --network=host option, where your container runs in the same network namespace as the rest of the systemâ€™s processes. But if you only want a single interface to be controlled directly by the container, you need to do some command-line voodoo.


Also, depending on your Wi-Fi drivers, this might not work at all. Some drivers support setting the network namespace while others will return an error.

	- [OpenWrt installation](https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi#installation) - for Raspberry Pi 4, you need to download the [latest development build](https://downloads.openwrt.org/snapshots/targets/bcm27xx/bcm2711/).

- [Compile drivers for ...](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/compile-drivers-for-rtl8821cu-wireless-adapter/90577/2)
	- It's not an easy thing to do since OpenWrt is not set up to let you compile things inside the device, you can only use the build system to cross-compile.
    - OpenWrt does not support dkms system for building and using out-of-tree Linux drivers so you cannot use that source but you would need to get a straight kernel patch and adapt it to the kernel used in OpenWrt, that's all sorts of painful.
