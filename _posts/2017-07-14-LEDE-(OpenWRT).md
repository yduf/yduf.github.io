> OpenWrt is a highly extensible GNU/Linux distribution for embedded devices (typically wireless routers). Unlike many other distributions for these routers, OpenWrt is built from the ground up to be a full-featured, easily modifiable operating system for your router. - [openwrt.org](https://openwrt.org/about) /[Raspberry-pi support](https://openwrt.org/toh/raspberry_pi_foundation/raspberry_pi)
