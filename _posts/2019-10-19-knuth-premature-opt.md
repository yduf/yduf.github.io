> We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%. A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified. It is often a mistake to make a priori judgments about what parts of a program are really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail. - Donald Knuth

[The Fifth Kind of Optimisation](https://tratt.net/laurie/blog/2025/the_fifth_kind_of_optimisation.html)
- Use a better algorithm.
- Use a better data-structure.
- Use a lower-level system.
- Accept a less precise solution.
- Use parallelisation.
