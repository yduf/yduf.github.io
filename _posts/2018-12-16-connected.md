- [Hoshen–Kopelman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoshen%E2%80%93Kopelman_algorithm) / [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling#Two-pass) - The algorithm makes two passes over the image: the first pass to assign temporary labels and record equivalences, and the second pass to replace each temporary label by the smallest label of its equivalence class.
