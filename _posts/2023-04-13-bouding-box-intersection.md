> Games use segment intersection tests all the time, for everything from line of sight to checking whether a bullet hit a monster. This is the most complicated of the four AABB tests, and is commonly known as a slab test. It finds the time of the lineâ€™s intersection with the near and far edges of each axis of the AABB. If they overlap, the segment is intersecting. - [Intersection Tests in 2D](http://noonat.github.io/intersect/)
