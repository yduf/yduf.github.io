Build components that you can reuse by assembling LEGO block.   
Data flows from top to bottom (from root to components), and only components downstream have to be repainted.

## Virtual DOM
A javascript object that describe the state of our app, converted to DOM by react.

{% highlight javascript %}
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// new React 4
function App() {
	return ... ; // as replaced render
}

// older
class Clock extends React.Component {
	render() {	// mandatory method
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Starting

use npm package `create-react-app 2.0`

{% highlight bash %}
npx create-react-app my-app          # run package without installing
npm start    # start the empty app
{% endhighlight %}

- react-scripts - install all tools + dependancies (webpack,...)

folders:
- public
- src
	- index.js
    - index.html

### Classes vs Hooks

Hooks are react specific.
