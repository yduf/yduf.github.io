## [Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban#Scientific_research)
The problem of solving Sokoban puzzles was first proved to be NP-hard. Further work showed that it was significantly more difficult than NP problems; it is PSPACE-complete.

Sokoban is difficult not only because of its large branching factor, but also because of its large search tree depth.
