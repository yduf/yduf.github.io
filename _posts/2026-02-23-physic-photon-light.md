> When glass is the right depth for given frequency there is no reflection at all(it happens up to 50 meters) - [The One Question About LIGHT That Feynman Couldn't Answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChTO9AYXuGU)

We do not understand quantum mechanics (We know the math, not the mechanism).

Light is neither a particle, neither a wave - it is something else entirely - it is light.
- wave model works well for intense light (billion of photon)
- when you start couting photon, it doesn't - and you still get interference pattern.
