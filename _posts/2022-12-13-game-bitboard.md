### [Fast 15x15 bit grid BFS: breadth first search](https://tech.io/playgrounds/53455/fast-15x15-bit-grid-bfs-breadth-first-search)

We represent a 15x15 grid as 4 64 bit unsigned integers. The last column, 16th, and row, also 16th, should always be empty.

The optimization idea is to split the board into white and black cells by odd and even indices, like a chess board. In that way black cells only have white neighbours and white cells only have black neighbours:
- The first 64 bit int (index 0) contains cells where x is even and y is even, i.e white cells. - The second 64 bit int (index 1) contains cells where x is odd and y is even, i.e. black cells. - The third 64 bit int (index 2) contains cells where x is even and y is odd, i.e. black cells. - The fourth 64 bit int (index 3) contains cells where x is odd and y is odd, i.e. white cells.

### [Optimizing breadth first search](https://www.codingame.com/playgrounds/38626/optimizing-breadth-first-search)

Convert a [naive BFS](https://chatgpt.com/share/6728aab3-147c-800d-88c4-08e11db1229c) to something more performant:
- don't allocate Node object - when visiting a Maze you can allocate all Node as cell in advance.
- don't use a std::queue: you know in advance how much cell you will visit and can use an queueStart index to move forward the end of your storage (so you reimplement a queue on a an array without any rolling).
- don't use any Hash: you can register in the very same array (or an other) which cell have been visited.

- BFS without classes: bit store (advertised as 10-15% boost to performance) for Node storage
- BFS without reset: ? ðŸš§ a way to accelerate re-initialisation of visited Node.
