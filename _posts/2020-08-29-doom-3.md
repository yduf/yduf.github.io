> With the release of the source code to both Doom 3 and the later BFG Edition, there now exists three options for Linux users wanting to play the game. Having gone through Doom 3 again, I decided it was time for me to compare them and give my thoughts on both the game and which of the three versions are best for Linux users in 2017. - [Playing Doom 3 on Linux in 2017](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/articles/playing-doom-3-on-linux-in-2017.10561)

## [RBDOOM-3-BFG](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/)
 - extract data using [lutris Native + GOG script](https://lutris.net/games/doom-3-bfg-edition/) 
	- select gog.exe windows installer
    - don't launch at the end => otherwise it freeze and clear the game folder (it executes the windows executable)
    - the RBDOOM-3-BFG executable retrieved by lutris has missing av-lib dependencies.
    	- recompiling the binary from [sources](https://github.com/RobertBeckebans/RBDOOM-3-BFG/) work perfectly well, afterwhat the games become playable.
