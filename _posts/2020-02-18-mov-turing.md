> The  instruction  we  choose  is __mov__,  which  can  do  both  loads and stores. We use no unusual addressing modes, self-modifying code, or runtime code generation. Using just this instruction (anda single unconditional branch at the end of the program to make non termination possible), we demonstrate how an arbitrary Turing machine can be simulated. - [pdf](http://drwho.virtadpt.net/files/mov.pdf) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22353713)
