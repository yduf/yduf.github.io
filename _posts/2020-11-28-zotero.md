> Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. - [Home](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25230582)

_I highly recommend everyone to use Zotero. Their original marketing as being 'for academics' is entirely wrong and it is a first-in-class bookmark/knowledge manager._ - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46737101)
- There are many software recommendations that seem sort of hype-y: Obsidian, Notion, Keybase, etc. Zotero is not that and is a daily driver for me for years. It has also replaced [Calibre](https://chatgpt.com/share/69877240-b7a8-800d-961d-d8eeed04232e) for me although YMMV there.

# [Library](https://chatgpt.com/share/69877d9b-faac-800d-9201-e860bd7ea0d2)

- One Personal Library per Zotero account
- Multiple Group Libraries (the usual solution)
or
- Multiple Zotero profiles (advanced workaround)

Collections ≠ libraries
- Collections are folders inside a single library.
- An item can appear in multiple collections without duplication.


# Integration

## [Adding Files to your Zotero Library](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files)

Files can be added to your Zotero library as either stored files or linked files. 

- **Stored files**, _which are the default_, are stored within the Zotero data directory, and Zotero will automatically manage them, including deleting them if you delete the attachment item in Zotero.
- **Linked Files** Zotero only stores a link to the location of the original file on your computer. Linked files are not synced, nor are they deleted if the attachment item is deleted in Zotero. 
- [**Web Snapshots**](https://www.zotero.org/support/attaching_files#web_snapshots) - Zotero can archive a webpage by creating a Snapshot—an offline file reflecting the state of the page at the time the snapshot was taken.

## [Syncing](https://www.zotero.org/support/sync)
<div style="
  border-left: 5px solid #e53935; /* red */
  background: #ffebee;
            
  padding: 1rem;
  margin: 1rem 0;
  border-radius: 6px;
"  markdown="1" >

Storing the Zotero data directory directly in a cloud storage folder is extremely likely to corrupt your Zotero database and should not be done.
</div>

The best way to access your Zotero library from multiple computers is to use Zotero syncing.
