> Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. - [Home](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25230582)

- I highly recommend everyone to use Zotero. Their original marketing as being 'for academics' is entirely wrong and it is a first-in-class bookmark/knowledge manager. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46737101)
	- There are many software recommendations that seem sort of hype-y: Obsidian, Notion, Keybase, etc. Zotero is not that and is a daily driver for me for years. It has also replaced Calibre for me although YMMV there.

## Integration
- [Firefox Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/#) - Save to Zotero from your browser
	- **Web Snapshots** - Zotero can archive a webpage by creating a Snapshot—an offline file reflecting the state of the page at the time the snapshot was taken.
