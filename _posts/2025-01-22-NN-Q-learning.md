### Discretize the World

Let's assume that we are able to discretize our environment as well as the set of actions available to us.
Then we can imagine that some fonction exist that would gives the best action possible for a certain situation (when positioned on a cell in our discretized environment).

This would be our Q-Function.

If we lived in a discretized environment we also can think of this Q-function as a Q-table:  
a table for which each entries is a tuple identified the cell we are in (in our environment) and map to a vector of available actions pondered by their score. The best action for this cell being the one having the highest value.

$ [ x, y, z] \Rightarrow ( a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$

In this situation there is a simple algorithm to learn that Q-function (and Q-table) by only looking at the reward of our actions (by simulating their outcome) ([^1])([^3)

### This World is to Big to fit in a table

Discretizing most world this way would require a huge table.
Rather than uzing an explicit table, we will use a neural network to learn and approximate that Q-Function without storing it in a table:
- the input layer will match the tuple identifying our cell
- the hidden layer is however need to be (convolution network / whatever)
- the output layer will match the set of actions available to us and give the learned weigth.

That way we trade memory of the Q-table for compactness of the NN, with same usage, but learning will take more time.

This is what is Deep Q-Learning [^2]

### Notes
the function to learn the Q-function is the Bellman equation for optimality.

	- DQN and Q-learning in general are performed **off-policy**, meaning that while learning, each update in the policy can use data collected at any point in its time of training,
    - PPO are **on-policy**, only using the data collected from the most up-to-date policy and making decisions based on that.
    - Both algorithms are **model-free**, meaning that while training agents, they do not have access to the model of the environment. The model of the environment is a function which predicts state transitions and rewards.
