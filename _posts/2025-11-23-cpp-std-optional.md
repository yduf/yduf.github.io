_the idea of "an optional type is a list with zero or one items in it" is much more normal in functional places_

_The original design (N3527 over a decade ago) for std::optional specifically says it's not the container with exactly zero or one items_

_Scala has it like this since day one. Tried to convince D to adopt it, but was unsuccessful._
