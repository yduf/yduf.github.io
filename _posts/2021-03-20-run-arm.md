> we can use [binfmt_misc](https://ownyourbits.com/2018/05/23/the-real-power-of-linux-executables/) to set up our own interpreters. Now we have all the pieces and we want to put them together. We need to setup binfmt_misc in order to use QEMU user mode as an interpreter for our binary format. - [Own your bits](https://ownyourbits.com/)

## [Running ARM programs under linux](https://gist.github.com/luk6xff/9f8d2520530a823944355e59343eadc1#running-arm-programs-under-linux-without-starting-qemu-vm)
First, cross-compile user programs with GCC-ARM toolchain. Then install qemu-arm-static so that you can run ARM executables directly on linux

{% highlight bash %}
# armel packages also exist
$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf libc6-dev-armhf-cross qemu-user-static
{% endhighlight %} 

Usage
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat > hello.c << EOF

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) { return printf("Hello ARM!\n"); }
EOF

$ arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -static  -ohello hello.c

$ file hello
hello: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked,

$ ./hello
Hello ARM!
{% endhighlight %}
