### [Recomputing issue](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=57276)
when severe changes are made, the model can break due to the [topological naming problem](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Topological_naming_problem) that is still unresolved in FreeCAD. It refers to the issue of a shape changing its internal name after a modelling operation (pad, cut, union, chamfer, fillet, etc.) is performed. This will result in other parametric features that depend on that shape to break or be incorrectly computed. 

- [Advice for creating stable models](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Feature_editing#Advice_for_creating_stable_models) 
	- Use dress ups, like fillets and chamfers, as late in the feature tree as possible
    - When creating datum geometry, do not attach it to generated geometry

## [Different workbench](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0XfBX9Eww4)

Each workbench provide a different set of tooling that can be applied on the same model.


[**About the differences and ramifications of using the Workbench Part and the Workbench  PartDesign workbenches.**](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_and_PartDesign)  
There has been much discussion over the years about the differences and ramifications of using the Workbench Part and the Workbench  PartDesign workbenches.

It is a good idea to use one or the other until the user is comfortable with one, then learn the other. It is also typically recommended that new users not mix them until [the ramifications](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_and_PartDesign#The_Ramifications) of doing so are understood. 


### [Part Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_Module)
The objects created with the Part Workbench are relatively simple; they are intended to be used with boolean operations (unions and cuts) in order to build more complex shapes. This modeling paradigm is known as the [constructive solid geometry](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Constructive_solid_geometry) (CSG) workflow. [it was the traditional methodology used in early CAD systems.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAB2ax3Mis)

- [Make a dice with FreeCAD](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/freecad-dice)


### [Part Design Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/PartDesign_Workbench)

The PartDesign Workbench provides a more modern [workflow to constructing shapes](https://youtu.be/u8otDF_C_fw?t=1163): it uses a parametrically defined sketch, that is extruded to form a basic solid body, which is then modified by parametric transformations (feature editing), until the final object is obtained.


### [Sketcher Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Sketcher_Workbench)
The Sketcher Workbench is used to create 2D geometries intended for use in the PartDesign Workbench.
the Sketcher also forms the basis of the feature editing methodology of creating solids.

The Sketcher workbench [features "constraints"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KATZg1PqM), allowing 2D shapes to follow precise geometrical definitions in terms of length, angles, and relationships (horizontality, verticality, perpendicularity, etc.). A constraint solver calculates the constrained-extent of 2D geometry and allows interactive exploration of degrees-of-freedom of the

- [scaling sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd5b8Bsxspo)
	- using draft workbench and converting back to sketch
    - using a calculated cell

### [Assembly3 Workbench](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3)
As of FreeCAD 0.19 there is [no official assembly workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/External_workbenches#Assembly_workbenches). However, several external tools have been created or are in development to manipulate objects to produce assemblies.

Note that the **assembly workbenches are generally incompatible with each other**. If you create an assembly with one of them, you should stick to the original workbench, and not use another assembly workbench in the same document. 

The assembly3 workbench use the constraint library from [solvespace](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Build-Instruction#solvespace) and integrate it into freecad.

Alternatives to assembly is just to position part by hand, which can work in most case.
see [Placing Parts in FreeCAD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfinO3EGXeo).
- using draft move, edit placement and edit alignment (which can be customized in toolbars)

### [Spreadsheet Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual:Using_spreadsheets)

Allows to centralize dimension of Body Part and sketch into a spreadsheet, which can be use formula as well.

### [Image Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Scaling) 

Allow using image for modelling parts.
- [Image Scaling](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Image_Scaling) - allow to [scale image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQcDoAhmoa8) between to points 
	- [use a scale in image for better results](https://youtu.be/xQcDoAhmoa8?t=553)
    - [align and sketch over the image](https://youtu.be/xQcDoAhmoa8?t=676)

### [Fastener Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Fasteners_Workbench)

An external workbench that can add/attach various fasteners to parts.
