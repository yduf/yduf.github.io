## Different workbench

Each workbench provide a different set of tooling that can be applied on the same model.


[**About the differences and ramifications of using the Workbench Part and the Workbench  PartDesign workbenches.**](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_and_PartDesign)  
There has been much discussion over the years about the differences and ramifications of using the Workbench Part and the Workbench  PartDesign workbenches.

It is a good idea to use one or the other until the user is comfortable with one, then learn the other. It is also typically recommended that new users not mix them until [the ramifications](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_and_PartDesign#The_Ramifications) of doing so are understood. 


### [Part Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_Module)
The objects created with the Part Workbench are relatively simple; they are intended to be used with boolean operations (unions and cuts) in order to build more complex shapes. This modeling paradigm is known as the [constructive solid geometry](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Constructive_solid_geometry) (CSG) workflow. [it was the traditional methodology used in early CAD systems.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izAB2ax3Mis)

### [Part Design Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/PartDesign_Workbench)

The PartDesign Workbench provides a more modern [workflow to constructing shapes](https://youtu.be/u8otDF_C_fw?t=1163): it uses a parametrically defined sketch, that is extruded to form a basic solid body, which is then modified by parametric transformations (feature editing), until the final object is obtained.


### [Sketcher Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Sketcher_Workbench)
The Sketcher Workbench is used to create 2D geometries intended for use in the PartDesign Workbench.
the Sketcher also forms the basis of the feature editing methodology of creating solids.

The Sketcher workbench [features "constraints"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9KATZg1PqM), allowing 2D shapes to follow precise geometrical definitions in terms of length, angles, and relationships (horizontality, verticality, perpendicularity, etc.). A constraint solver calculates the constrained-extent of 2D geometry and allows interactive exploration of degrees-of-freedom of the

### [Assembly3 Workbench](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3)
As of FreeCAD 0.19 there is [no official assembly workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/External_workbenches#Assembly_workbenches). However, several external tools have been created or are in development to manipulate objects to produce assemblies.

Note that the assembly workbenches are generally incompatible with each other. If you create an assembly with one of them, you should stick to the original workbench, and not use another assembly workbench in the same document. 

The assembly3 workbench use the constraint library from [solvespace](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD_assembly3/wiki/Build-Instruction#solvespace) and integrate it into freecad.





## STL convertion

- [How to convert STL to STEP using FreeCAD](https://grabcad.com/tutorials/how-to-convert-stl-to-step-using-freecad)

Par workben Workflow:
- open stl file => mesh
- Part / create shape from mesh (0.1 tolerance) => part mesh
- Part / convert to solid => solid
- Part / create a copy / refine shape => solid simplified
- last solid must be inserted in a body to be editable in part design workbench
