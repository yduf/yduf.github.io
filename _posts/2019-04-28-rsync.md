    - How much risk am I willing to take? 
        - A common but risky approach is to store a backup on the same machine that requires backing up.
        - Thus, the initial step is to establish a management plan, balancing security and cost. The safest backup is often the one stored farthest from the source machine. However, this approach introduces challenges related to space and bandwidth
