- -v - verbose mode

- -h - human-readable, output numbers in a human-readable format.
- --remove-source-files - remove source after backup complete

        - Thus, the initial step is to establish a management plan, balancing security and cost. The safest backup is often the one stored farthest from the source machine. However, this approach introduces challenges related to space and bandwidth
