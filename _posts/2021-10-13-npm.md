> Javascript Package Manager (alternative to yarn) for Node.js - NPM

Rely upon package.json for metadata and dependancies (comparable to ruby gemfile)
They are installed by `npm install` 

Package can be installed locally or globally (`-g`)



Some package:
- live-server - js web server serving local file 
- lodash (`_`) - scala like shortcuts ?
- browserify - module for browser with support for old version of js
	- create a bundle.js file
