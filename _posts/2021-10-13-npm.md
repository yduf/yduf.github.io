> Node.js Tool & Package Manager  - NPM

Rely upon package.json for metadata and dependancies and dev-dependancies (comparable to ruby bundler gemfile)
They are installed by `npm install` 

Package can be installed locally or globally (`-g`)

{% highlight bash %}
npm install      # install package dependancies
npm start        # start development web server 
npm run build	 # build "release" version of the site/app (minifying & optimising)
{% endhighlight %}

Some package:
- live-server - js web server serving local file 
- lodash (`_`) - scala like shortcuts ?
- browserify - module for browser with support for old version of js
	- create a bundle.js file
