$\int_{0}^{\inf} f(t) \mathcal{e}^{st} \,dt$

$f(t) = 1$ -> \int_{0}^{\inf} f(t) \mathcal{e}^{st} \,dt = 1/s$

What does it means to integrate a complex function ?
- integrating scalar function gives area below the function
- but as generalisation it can be seen as the mean on sum of intervall
- this generalize as barycenter for complex function

Limited Continutation
- How to defined a complex function outside of it's defintion domain
	- either there is no such extension
    - or there is only one that exist
