> I mentioned a data structure known as the "region", which is a list of rectangles. When I first built the X server codebase, I took the region code from pixman...simply because I didn't understand the algorithms... I recently decided to investigate the data structures and algorithms behind regions, and I finally understood it. What I found I'm going to share with you. - [magcius](https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/regions.html)
