[Format Gallery](https://formats.kaitai.io/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45469285) - All formats in this gallery have formal specifications in Kaitai Struct language.

    	- Wuffs is great. I use it in [Substrata](https://substrata.info/) [](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40395593) for loading PNGs. It is both faster and safer than LibPNG.
