POSIX _per-file system_ unique identifier for a file (each drive being an independant filesystem) - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inode) / [File System Continued](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/winter16/cs111/scribe/12d/index.html)

### Hardlink

Allows to share content + metadata except the name which may differ.
**hardlink** cannot link to directory => This would cause a loop in the filesystem and that's why [it's prohibited by the filesystem](https://askubuntu.com/questions/210741/why-are-hard-links-not-allowed-for-directories)

- [fastest way to find all the file with the same inode?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340263/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-find-all-the-file-with-the-same-inode)
{% highlight bash %}
$ find . -inum 1234

### [Symlink](https://chatgpt.com/share/67a4b095-09f4-800d-a28f-d3f3e1f4dfa5)

In Linux, a symlink (symbolic link) itself is a separate file, and it has its own metadata, independent of the target file.

**Metadata Stored on a Symlink (Independent of Target)**
- File Type: symlink
- Ownership (User and Group): A symlink has its own owner (UID) and group (GID).
- Timestamps
- Size: The size of a symlink is the length of the path it stores

**What Metadata is NOT Stored in a Symlink?**
- File content
- target file permission
- target file size
