> In a closed network (where you know every device), NFS is a fine choice. With a good network, throughput it disgustingly fast and at the same time less CPU intensive on the server. It's very simple to set up and you can toggle readonly on shares you don't need to be writeable. - [NFS vs Samba](https://askubuntu.com/questions/7117/which-to-use-nfs-or-samba#7124)

## [NFS & Symlink](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/135048/how-to-follow-symlinks-in-nfs/460929#460929)

Symbolic links only contain a path to another file or directory on the originating system where they're being shared from. Unless you take care to make the links relative or to duplicate the same directory structures on remote systems as the originator of the share, they simply will not work.

This can be easily fixed: see [symlink]({% post_url 2021-10-18-symlink %})


# Client

### List exporter folder for given server
{% highlight cpp %}
showmount -e [server ip]
{% endhighlight %}
  
### Mount Shared Directory
{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo mkdir -p /nfs/backup
$ sudo mount 192.168.0.125:/mnt/Backup /nfs/backup
{% endhighlight %}

# Auto-mounting an NFS share

### Automount (systemd)
The main difference is that **autofs**, with the right auto scripts, will dynamically list the available shares. So you don't need to pre-define and hard-code which machines/shares should be made available.

With **systemd's automount**, only shares which you have pre-configured will be visible.

## Install

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt install nfs-common
{% endhighlight %}

### Autofs

- [ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Autofs)
- [How to use autofs](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/using-autofs-mount-nfs-shares)
- [stack](https://askubuntu.com/questions/884389/auto-mount-nfs-via-autonfs)

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install autofs
{% endhighlight %}

Add the following line at the end of [**/etc/auto.master**](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/autofs) 

{% highlight text %}
/nfs   /etc/auto.nfs	--ghost,--timeout=30
{% endhighlight %}

Create **/etc/auto.nfs**, and specify [nfs mount options](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/nfs.5.html):
{% highlight text %}
<server-name>   -fstype=nfs4,soft   <server-ip/host>:/
{% endhighlight %}

Reload /etc/init.d/autofs
{% highlight bash %}
$ systemctl start autofs
{% endhighlight %}

# Host

[Creating the Exported Directories on the Host](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-nfs-mount-on-ubuntu-18-04#step-3-%E2%80%94-configuring-the-nfs-exports-on-the-host-server)

`sudo micro` **/etc/exports**
{% highlight text %}
directory_to_share    client(share_option1,...,share_optionN)
{% endhighlight %}
  
Then restart service: `sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server`

### Options details
**rw:** This option gives the client computer both read and write access to the volume.
  
**sync:** This option forces NFS to write changes to disk before replying. This results in a more stable and consistent environment since the reply reflects the actual state of the remote volume. However, it also reduces the speed of file operations.
  
**no_subtree_check:** This option prevents subtree checking, which is a process where the host must check whether the file is actually still available in the exported tree for every request. This can cause many problems when a file is renamed while the client has it opened. In almost all cases, it is better to disable subtree checking.
  
**no_root_squash:** By default, NFS translates requests from a root user remotely into a non-privileged user on the server. This was intended as security feature to prevent a root account on the client from using the file system of the host as root. no_root_squash disables this behavior for certain shares.
