> doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far the fastest both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives. It brings the ability of compiled languages such as D / Rust / Nim to have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast, transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface. - [DOCtest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)

## [DOCtest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)

doctest is modeled after Catch and some parts of the code have been taken directly - [feature comparison](https://github.com/martinmoene/catch-lest-other-comparison):
- (+) much faster to compile than catch below
- (+) support [meson]({% post_url 2020-08-12-build-meson %}) build system
- (+) [subcase](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/blob/master/doc/markdown/tutorial.md#test-cases-and-subcases) test (like catch2 scenarios).
- (+) can be used alongside production code.
- (+) decorators
- (+) vscode integration through [C++ TestMate]({% post_url 2021-06-25-cpp-test-vscode %})

- (-) missing [Matchers](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/matchers.md#using-matchers)

## [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
> a multi-paradigm test framework for C++. - [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) / [v2 to v3](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top) / [The Coding Nest](https://codingnest.com/)
[Command line](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/command-line.md#command-line)

- Pros
	- Header only
	- support [Nested initialising section](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md#test-cases-and-sections) as well as BDD syntax
    - default and custom [Matchers](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/matchers.md#using-matchers)
	- main() code can be [customized](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/own-main.md#top)
- Cons
	- slow compilation => see [v2 to v3](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/devel/docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top) for improvment
	- No Mocks
