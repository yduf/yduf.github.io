> an unsupervised machine learning technique used to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional) representation of a higher-dimensional data set while preserving the topological structure of the data. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map)

### Project Idea

Use an approach similar to _one million screenshot_ below to browse personnal photo archive.

	- [PMTiles](https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46438283) a production-ready, single-file, static container for vector tiles built around HTTP range requests.
		- PMTiles is a general format for tiled data addressed by Z/X/Y coordinates. This can be cartographic basemap vector tiles, remote sensing observations, JPEG images, or more.
        - PMTiles readers use HTTP Range Requests to fetch only the relevant tile or metadata inside a PMTiles archive on-demand.
