> AppImage is a format to distribute an entire application as a single executable file. To run the app, an user simply needs to run this file — there’s no intermediate installation step. The application runs off this package, and it doesn’t place files on the base system. In addition, the AppImage file contains all libraries and files it needs to run, and this allows them to work on a large number of distributions. - [What is an AppImage?](https://www.booleanworld.com/creating-linux-apps-run-anywhere-appimage/)

> AppImageLauncher makes your Linux desktop AppImage ready™. By installing it, you won't ever have to worry about AppImages again. You can always double click them without making them executable first, just like you should be able to do nowadays. You can integrate AppImages with a single mouse click, and manage them from your application launcher. Updating and removing AppImages becomes as easy as never before.

[**Snap**](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/disabling-automatic-refresh-for-snap-from-store/707) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18216340) - A very important aspect of **snap** that should have been noted in the article is the lack of user control over the a snap's updating process; **Users are not allowed to control when updates are applied**, leading to a windows 10-like user experience

	- Whereas Docker is focusing on containers for servers operated by “devops”, AppImage is focusing on desktop applications operated by end users.  
Whereas Docker puts everything (besides the Kernel) into a container and shields it from the host, AppImages use the host OS and do not shield the application from it.  
That being said, you could use AppImage for server applications, and you could bundle everything if you wanted. But then you could probably just as well use Docker.
