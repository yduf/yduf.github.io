[Using VSCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srPKBhzgZhc) with PICO-8.
As well as other [Using External Tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srPKBhzgZhc)

## [`# include`](https://www.lexaloffle.com/dl/docs/pico-8_manual.html#_INCLUDE)
_put all of your code in a separate file and using [#include](https://youtu.be/srPKBhzgZhc?feature=shared&t=305)_
you can use individual tabs from carts by going [`#include cartname.p8:2`](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/17e8wke/include_file_in_different_directory/) which would include any code on the second tab inside the cart. 

`#INCLUDE` can be used for things like:
- Sharing code between cartridge (libraries or common multi-cart code)
- Using an external code editor without needing to edit the .p8 file directly.
- Treating a cartridge as a data file that loads a PICO-8 editing tool to modify it.
- Loading and storing data generated by an external (non-PICO-8) tool.

## Debug
### [`printh`](https://maxzsol.com/getting-started-with-local-development-for-pico-8-and-vs-code/#step-11.-start-coding-and-start-debugging)

the `printh` function to output text to the terminal.
