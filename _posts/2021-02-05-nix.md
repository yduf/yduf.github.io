title: What Is Nix ?
tags: dev docker

> On Debian, Fedora, etc, installing a package means letting it put files wherever it likes; which effectively gives the package author root on your system. Not a good base for sandboxing!
>
> Also, they make it difficult to try out 3rd-party software, or to test newer versions of just some packages.
> 
> In 2003 I created 0install to address these problems, and Nix has very similar goals. - [NixOS](https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2021/03/07/qubes-lite-with-kvm-and-wayland/#nixos)
