> The Sliding window is a problem-solving technique for problems that involve arrays/lists. These problems are easy to solve using a brute force approach in O(n^2) or O(n^3). Using the 'sliding window' technique, we can reduce the time complexity to O(n). - [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8269916/what-is-sliding-window-algorithm-examples) / [How to Solve Sliding Window Problems](https://medium.com/outco/how-to-solve-sliding-window-problems-28d67601a66)
