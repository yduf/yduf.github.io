> Cross-sectional age-skill profiles suggest that cognitive skills start declining by age 30 if not earlier... Two main results emerge. First, average skills increase strongly into the forties before decreasing slightly in literacy and more strongly in numeracy. Second, skills decline at older ages only for those with below-average skill usage. White-collar and higher-educated workers with above-average usage show increasing skills even beyond their forties.  - [Use it or lose it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43279494) / [pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00790)
