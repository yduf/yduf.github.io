>  This idea of just building a new system over on the side, without any of the problems of the old one, is a fantasy.

 A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. - [Gall's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law)

### Stroustrup
- A lot of the so-called ‘safe’ languages outsource all the low-level stuff to C or C++ 
- Global static analysis is just unaffordable
- Being careful doesn’t scale
