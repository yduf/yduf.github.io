>  Insanity is often marked by the dominance of reason and the exclusion of creativity and humour. Pure reason is inhuman. The madmanâ€™s mind moves in a perfect, but narrow, circle, and his explanation of the world is comprehensive, at least to him. - [G.K.Chesterton](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42902931)
