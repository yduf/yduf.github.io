> We start by analyzing word2vec, a classic algorithm that is able to map words to numerical vectors that encode information about the meaning and similarity of words. This will lay the foundation for our first look at graph embedding algorithms with node2vec that leverages the basic structure of word2vec and some intuitions about random walks to generate meaningful vector representations of each node in an arbitrary graph. - [Graph Embeddings 101](https://graphs4sci.substack.com/p/graph-embeddings-101#)
