> In software development there are many concepts that at first glance seem useful and sound, but, after considering the consequences of their implementation and use, are actually horrifying. Examples include [thread cancellation](https://lwn.net/Articles/683118/), [variable length arrays](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/10/27/), and [memory aliasing](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2018/07/20/#strict-aliasing).
