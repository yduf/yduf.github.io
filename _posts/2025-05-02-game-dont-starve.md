> [a 2013 survival game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Starve). The game follows a scientist named Wilson who finds himself in a dark, dreary parallel world known as the Constant and must survive as long as possible. To this end, the player must keep Wilson alive, fed, and mentally stable as he avoids a variety of surreal and supernatural enemies that will try to kill and devour him. The game's Adventure mode adds depth to the sparse plot and pits Wilson against the game's supposed antagonist, Maxwell. - [wiki](https://dontstarve.fandom.com/wiki/Don%27t_Starve_Wiki) / [gog](https://www.gog.com/fr/game/dont_starve)
