- LZ4 has branchless decompression, and lower cache footprint, thus it can work on low end, and non-desktop CPUs equally well.
zstd, brotly, snappy were seemingly all made with high end x86 capabilities in mind. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25926311)

- LZ4 is so fast thereâ€™s almost no reason to NOT have it on for zfs volumes. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25926203)
	- For (low) bandwidth metrics yes, for any kind of latency sensitive workload not really.
