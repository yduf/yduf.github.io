## [$stdout - Opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTpG5obPV8)
>> I like Ruby, I like Go
>> But strong typing for the win
> Atom over VScode
> And VScode over Vim
> I like spaces over tabs
> Underscores over dash
> 80 characters per line
> And a hundred lines per class
> I like only double quotes
> Semicolons for the close
> If you don’t do what I like
> Then your pull request is froze
> I don’t like this naming style
> I think we should move this file
> And can we add a comment here?
> Please just let me commandeer
> Got opinions on opinions ‘bout how we should operate
> Deviations from the style guide I just cannot tolerate
> I need my code consistent
> Not one indentation missing
> So please install my linter
> ‘Cause I don’t like when it’s different
> 
> (Chorus 2x) 
> You should write code like I write it
> You should like it if I like it
> Trust my choice and tag along
> I am right and you are wrong
> 
> Please don’t call me OCD
> It’s the only way to be
> I can’t let you code with me
> If you never worked in C
> Or don’t practice TDD
> Or aren’t down with IRC
> Or don’t read XKCD
> Or you use MongoDB
> Can we add some unit tests?
> We use SASS not CSS
> JSON API requests
> My opinion never ends
> I’m just waiting to suggest
> I’ll recommend a standing desk
> Tell you which coffee is best
> Bitcoin’s hot, you should invest
> Got opinions on opinions ‘bout how you should live your life
> Deviations from the style guide ain’t just ‘bout the code you write
> Still I need my code consistent
> Not one indentation missing
> So please install my linter
> ‘Cause I don’t like when it’s different
> 
> (Interlude of opinions)
> 
> (Chorus 2x)
> You should write code like I write it
> You should like it if I like it
> Trust my choice and tag along
> I am right and you are wrong
