You should like it if I like it  
Trust my choice and tag along  
I am right and you are wrong 
- [$stdout - Opinions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTpG5obPV8)  

I like Ruby, I like Go  
But strong typing for the win  
Atom over VScode  
And VScode over Vim  
I like spaces over tabs  
Underscores over dash  
80 characters per line  
And a hundred lines per class  
I like only double quotes  
Semicolons for the close  
If you don’t do what I like  
Then your pull request is froze  
I don’t like this naming style  
I think we should move this file  
And can we add a comment here?  
Please just let me commandeer  
Got opinions on opinions ‘bout how we should operate  
Deviations from the style guide I just cannot tolerate  
I need my code consistent  
Not one indentation missing  
So please install my linter  
‘Cause I don’t like when it’s different  

(Chorus 2x)  
You should write code like I write it  
You should like it if I like it  
Trust my choice and tag along  
I am right and you are wrong  

Please don’t call me OCD  
It’s the only way to be  
I can’t let you code with me  
If you never worked in C  
Or don’t practice TDD  
Or aren’t down with IRC  
Or don’t read XKCD  
Or you use MongoDB  
Can we add some unit tests?  
We use SASS not CSS  
JSON API requests  
My opinion never ends  
I’m just waiting to suggest  
I’ll recommend a standing desk  
Tell you which coffee is best  
Bitcoin’s hot, you should invest  
Got opinions on opinions ‘bout how you should live your life  
Deviations from the style guide ain’t just ‘bout the code you write  
Still I need my code consistent  
Not one indentation missing  
So please install my linter  
‘Cause I don’t like when it’s different  

(Interlude of opinions)  

(Chorus 2x)  
You should write code like I write it  
You should like it if I like it  
Trust my choice and tag along  
I am right and you are wrong
