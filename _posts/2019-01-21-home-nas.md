## Issues

### Memory

#### [Memtest86](https://www.memtest86.com/download.htm)
- test DR 1600 / 1.35V
	- bank A alone => pass
    - bank B alone => pass
    - bank A+B     => pass

** Does not seems to be an issue **

For History
#### Memtest86+

**=> system stopping, after 2s in memtest86+. 5.01**

- Tried to change set memory in bios:
	- DR 1600 / 1.35V => failed
    - DR 1600 / 1.5V  => failed
    - DR 1333 / 1.35V => failed
    - DR 1333 / 1.5V  => failed
    
- Next step, test ram individually.
	- ram 1 : 8Go => failed
    - ram 2 : 8Go => failed

- Removed additional sata card => same
Maybe an issue with [Memtest86+]({% post_url 2020-07-23-memtest %})

> using 16 Gig (8×2) DDR3L 1866 RAM. Like I already said, it seemed to work, but under heavy loads I got random kernel panics (Kernel 4.18.20), usually SMP NOPTI and sometimes even more spectacular blow ups. I was thinking bad RAM module? Anyway, I pulled a module and ran 8 Gig with the result that I cannot kill it with any load. A quick check of the Intel J3455 Datasheet says only an 8 Gig MAX - [issue](http://www.mgreene.org/?p=290)

I have since read that the board might not be automatically powering the RAM or the RAM is not quite right. A possible fix might be to take the board out if AUTO and increasing the voltage or lowering the speed. I have not tried this 

### LAN [Realtek RTL8111GR](https://tuxbyte.com/how-to-get-your-realtek-rtl8111rtl8168-working-updated-guide/) **issue** with default driver when too much load

> To solve this problem you have to use the official Realtek **r8168** driver instead of the **r8169** driver, which is included in the Linux Kernel.

- [Potential data loss and security breach when used with nfs server](https://github.com/mtorromeo/r8168/issues/4)

{% highlight bash %}
$ lsmod | grep r81						# check driver present
# default install gives =>
r8169                  81920  0
{% endhighlight %}

#### Easy fix (reboot to activate)
> ** 8.045.08 - Still crashing on heavy load with this driver **
=> may be this is not the real issue

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install r8168-dkms			# force support of that driver
<reboot>
$ lsmod | grep r8168						# check presence
r8168                 524288  0
  
$sudo ethtool -i enp1s0	# check if ethernet card is using the right driver
driver: r8168
version: 8.045.08-NAPI
firmware-version: 
expansion-rom-version: 
bus-info: 0000:01:00.0
supports-statistics: yes
supports-test: no
supports-eeprom-access: no
supports-register-dump: yes
supports-priv-flags: no
{% endhighlight %}

#### Manual install
> version 8.048.02 available on [https://github.com/mtorromeo/r8168/tree/master/src)
  
=> pb a l'install...
