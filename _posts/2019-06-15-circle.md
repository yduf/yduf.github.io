> How do we know that the circumference of every circle has the same ratio π to its diameter? The following theorem assures us. *Circles are to one another as their circumscribed squares* - [Euclid, XII, 2](https://www.themathpage.com/atrig/circle.htm#pi/4)

Remarkably enough, as we will see, the theorem applies both to the boundaries and the areas.
