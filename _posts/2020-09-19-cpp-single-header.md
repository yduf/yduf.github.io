> Generally, the following is a list of small, easy-to-integrate, portable libraries which are usable from C and/or C++, and should be able to be compiled on both 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. - [nothings/single_file_libs](https://github.com/nothings/single_file_libs)

- [Amalgamate](https://github.com/vinniefalco/Amalgamate) - A cross platform command line tool for producing an amalgamation of C or C++ sources.


- [archive](https://github.com/voidah/archive) - Simple, compact, endian-safe and header-only serialization/deserialization for C++

- [linalg](https://github.com/sgorsten/linalg#matrices) - inspired by the syntax of popular shading and compute languages and is intended to serve as a lightweight alternative to projects such as GLM, Boost.QVM or Eigen in domains such as computer graphics, computational geometry, and physical simulation.

- [lz4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4) - LZ4 is lossless compression algorithm, providing compression speed > 500 MB/s per core.

- [Plog]({% post_url 2023-09-27-cpp-lib-plog %}) - Pretty powerful logging library in about 1000 lines of code. Cross-platform

- [MicroPather](http://www.grinninglizard.com/MicroPather/) - a path finder and A* solver (astar or a-star) written in platform independent C++ that can be easily integrated into existing code. MicroPather focuses on being a path finding engine for video games but is a generic A* solver.

- [NanoJPEG](https://keyj.emphy.de/nanojpeg/) - a compact JPEG decoder


- [Miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) - a lossless, high performance data compression library in a single source file that implements the zlib (RFC 1950) and Deflate (RFC 1951) compressed data format specification standards.

- [tree.h](https://github.com/openbsd/src/blob/c1d6f13173b788e34852a303bda0c5a53861979e/sys/sys/tree.h) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26746674) - splay trees and red-black trees

- [Zdepth](https://github.com/catid/Zdepth) - Lossless depth buffer compression designed and tested for Microsoft Azure Kinect DK. Based on the Facebook Zstd library.

### Profiling

- [utl::profiler](https://github.com/DmitriBogdanov/UTL/blob/master/docs/module_profiler.md#utlprofiler) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43680477) - Single-Header Profiler for C++17
