> The GROUP BY clause is used often used in conjunction with an aggregate function such as SUM() and AVG(). The GROUP BY clause reduces the number of rows returned by rolling them up and calculating the sums or averages for each group.  
> The PARTITION BY clause divides the result set into partitions and changes how the window function is calculated. The PARTITION BY clause does not reduce the number of rows returned. - [SQL PARTITION BY](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-window-functions/sql-partition-by/)
