> Given the coordinates of the positions of Alice, the rabbit and the hole, as well as the respective speeds of Alice and the rabbit, say whether Alice can catch the rabbit before it disappears. - [Interception of a Linear Trajectory With Constant Speed](http://zulko.github.io/blog/2013/11/11/interception-of-a-linear-trajectory-with-constant-speed/)

It is straightforward that, since we are looking for the fastest catch, Aliceâ€™s trajectory towards C must be a straight line.

Instead of previous model, consider that we collide at time $t$. With $v_A$ and $v_B$ being respective vector speed of $A$ and $B$ we got:

$A + t v_A = B + t v_B = C$ the point of collision.
