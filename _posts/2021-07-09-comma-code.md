> A comma code is a type of prefix-free code in which a **comma**, a particular symbol or sequence of symbols, occurs at the end of a code word and never occurs otherwise. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_code) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27727214)

For example, Fibonacci coding is a comma code in which the comma is 11. 11 and 1011 are valid Fibonacci code words, but 101, 0111, and 11011 are not.
