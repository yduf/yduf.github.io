> You have understanding and intellingence and awareness... And somehow, understanding is in the middle of it. Could you say of an entity that it's actually intelligent if it doesn't have the quality of understanding? - [the limitations of a computational view of consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orMtwOz6Db0)

> [Giulio Tononi](https://bmcneurosci.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2202-5-42) (prominent neuroscientist, originator of the Integrated Information Theory of consciousness): “Consciousness is everything we experience. Think of it as what abandons us every night when we fall into dreamless sleep and returns the next morning when we wake up. Without consciousness, as far as we are concerned, there would be neither an external world nor our own selves: there would be nothing at all.”
