> Build multiple hash tables on binary code substrings that enables exact K-nearest neighbor search in Hamming space.  The algorithm is straightforward to implement,  storage  efficient,  and  it  has  sub-linear  runtime behavior for uniformly distributed codes. - [Fast Search in Hamming Space with Multi-Index Hashing](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~norouzi/research/papers/multi_index_hashing.pdf) / [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47487949/51386)
