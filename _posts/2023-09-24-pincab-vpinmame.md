> PinMAME emulates the hardware found in almost every solid state pinball machine created from the earliest days of CPU-controlled machines (mid 1970's) through 2014 (Stern SAM), with around 770 emulated unique Pinball machines and many more clones/revisions (overall more than 2700 sets). - [github](https://github.com/vpinball/pinmame)

For [Visual Pinball Standalone](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball/blob/standalone/standalone/README.md) it is embeded via libpinmame.

It's automatically installed if you use the installer. If you just build VPX from source (not standalone version), you probably don't have PinMAME at all. - [ External Tables & Roms with Visual Pinball built from source #45 ](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball/issues/45#issuecomment-1066202713)
