> With ventoy, you don't need to format the disk over and over, you just need to copy the ISO/WIM/IMG/EFI files to the USB drive and boot them directly. - [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24241485)

### [Install](https://www.ventoy.net/en/doc_start.html)
> Can be updated without recreating the image

Live cd is useless for linux

{% highlight bash %}
$ lsblk # find key
sdb      8:16   1  14,4G  0 disk 
└─sdb1   8:17   1  14,4G  0 part /media/yves/KINGSTON

# install as root 
sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -i /dev/sdb

# update / does not erase .iso data
sh Ventoy2Disk.sh -u /dev/sdb

{% endhighlight %}


## Copy ISO files
just copy iso files to the mounted /ventoy partition.
**The full path of the iso file (directories,subdirectories and file name) could NOT contain space or non-ascii characters**

Work with:
- Linux mint
- Gparted
- Memtest
- LinuxCNC
- Windows ? - [Gandalf rescue ISO](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38684836)
