> Why create a FPS in JavaScript in a total of 13k (compressed)? There are a few reasons. But probably the best answer is that the JS13K contest FAQ answers the question “Can I use WebGL?” with “Yes, though it might be hard to fit it into 13 kilobytes if you plan on doing an FPS game.” - [Nicholas Carlini](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2019/javascript-doom-clone-13k.html)
