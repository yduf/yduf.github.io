>I don't have any issues with Python's packaging ecosystem anymore, having settled comfortably into a pyenv+virtualenv+pip-tools as my "stack" after going around the block a few times.

>But even so, I must recognise how awful the experience is for new users. It's taken me years to settle into this system, and it can take half a day to get someone up to speed with these tools if they haven't used them. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37250807) / [Interview with a Senior Python Developer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgxklT94W0I)

# Packaging Mess

[![caption](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/python_environment_2x.png)](https://xkcd.com/1987/)

## UV / Poetry

poetry gave us lock files and consistent installs for years. uv is much, much faster however.

- [UV is the best thing to happen to the Python ecosystem in a decade](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45751400) 
	- [	How uv got so fast](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46393992) - _The most surprising part of uv's success to me isn't Rust at all, it's how much speed we "unlocked" just by finally treating Python packaging as a well-specified systems problem instead of a pile of historical accidents._
    	- [_That feels like cargo-culting the toolchain_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46398022) - Jokes aside, what you describe is a common pattern. It's also why Google internally they used to get decent speedups from rewriting some old C++ project in Go for a while: **the magic was mostly in the rewrite-with-hindsight.**
	- You might be interested in pixi, which is roughly to conda as uv is to pip
    	- Pixi is what FreeCAD is now using. (Along with Rattler). - It makes building FreeCAD pretty trivial, which is a huge deal considering FreeCAD’s really complex Python and non-python, cross-platform dependencies.


## Pip / Conda

## [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) / [VirtualEnv](https://pythonbasics.org/virtualenv/)
The pyenv project was forked from rbenv and ruby-build, and modified for Python. - [Is there a Python alternative to RVM or Rbenv?](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-Python-alternative-to-RVM-or-Rbenv?share=1)

**pyenv** - allows to work with different python version  
[**virtualenv**](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-to-use-virtualenv-python/) - for same python version, allows tu use different set of installed library. ex: `virtualenv -p python3 py-opencv` 
**pyenv-virtualenv** - is a plugin for pyenv by the same author as pyenv, to allow you to use pyenv and virtualenv at the same time conveniently.  


### [virtualenv](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-to-use-virtualenv-python/)


{% highlight cpp %}
$ virtualenv -p python3 mytest  # create
$ source mytest/bin/activate    # activate in bash
{% endhighlight %}

For [other shell like Fish](https://chatgpt.com/share/67116cb0-3b6c-800d-9c92-ecfe2ad0afec) use `source mytest/bin/activate.fish` instead

## Conda - see [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37250807) comment
> Don't need sudo right to use it.

 	- [Anaconda vs. miniconda](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45421163/anaconda-vs-miniconda)
    	- Choose Anaconda if you are new to conda or Python
        - Choose Miniconda if you Just want fast access to Python and the conda commands, and wish to sort out the other programs later

## Fish shell support
Run 'conda init fish' and restart your shell.
