> The hexapod is the clever design work of Jaimie Mantzel, a somewhat eccentric Canadian inventor. In fact, the Attacknid is really a miniature version of [the Giant Robot Mantzel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=698&v=YjTcReaOqQ0) recently finished building. What makes Mantzel’s design impressive is that despite its six legs, only two DC motors control its movement ­— compare that with the 12 servo motors minimum you’d find in any other six-legged walker. - [Arduino project: Hacking the Attacknid](https://web.archive.org/web/20140319044803/http://apcmag.com:80/arduino-project-hacking-attacknid.htm#null)

## Arduino project: Hacking the Attacknid

The PCB actually has 10x empty spots next to the switch contacts that seem to have been purposely included for this very purpose/testing/development.

First things first though - I will drill some holes and mount 12 GPIO pins on the handset to break it out to connect via wires to the corresponding spots on the PCB.

8 will go to the 8 buttons.
2 will go to the 2 (apparently) ground lines that the 2 clusters of 4 buttons short to.
the other 2 will go to the +3v / gnd supply lines in the battery compartment.

The controller has something that resembles a NRF24L01 RF transceiver in it.
