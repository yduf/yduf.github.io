> As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub. - [Blub Paradox](https://wiki.c2.com/?BlubParadox) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36045353)

Example
- Go generic, thought as not necessary, but still added [long afterward to the language](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36045353)
