> If you have a tight loop, LRU is going to be perfect as long as the loop fits in cache, but it's going to cause a miss every time if the loop doesn't fit. A random eviction policy degrades gracefully as the loop gets too big. - [Caches: LRU v. random](https://danluu.com/2choices-eviction/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39093109)
