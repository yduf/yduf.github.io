> Youâ€™re thinking of a relay cutting power to the radiator as a whole. That is indeed not a good idea and may damage it long term. - [Fil pilote](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/fil-pilote-easy-interface/106286/16) / [adomotique](https://www.adomotique.com/content/32-commande-distance-chauffage-fil-pilote)

There are 6 commands in total. Two of them require a microcontroller to generate, as they use precise signal timing. The other 4 can be generated using relays and diodes. Two basic commands can be generated without a diode.

**Without diode, only a relay needed:**  
0V : Mode confort  
230V: Mode eco  

**With a diode:**  
Negative half wave: Mode hors gel  
Positive half wave: Turns off the heater
