> Various tutorial on how to make a 3d printer enclosure with Ikea lack table.

## [Instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/3d-Printer-Enclosure-from-Upcycled-Furniture/)

- drill off center for leg/table attachement, because of the big metal screw using to holds leg.

This gives better access to the printer, and can be used when the table are put in a corner.

- magnetic strip
- The lip of the handle is where you stick the magnetic strip that holds the doors shut firmly.
- The handle is made of 3 parts the handle and handle parts x2 these are friction welded together.

### Extra Height => Leg Extensions

The Lack tables are not tall enough to fit a printer comfortably, so extensions are necessary. I wanted the ultimate in servicability, so what better way than making the entire top come off? Easiest way was to design two piece leg extensions. [The cone design](https://thingiverse-production-new.s3.amazonaws.com/renders/8e/8d/e6/c6/82/8cc12f27f36902d827aab3bf8ee5fba6_preview_featured.jpg) makes it trivial to assemble and it's plenty sturdy. I stood on one of them which did not hurt it. Was contemplating some sort of locking mechanism to lock the top down but it's not really necessary. The extensions use hidden screws and the corners are even rounded to match the radius of the Lack legs.

- It's also possible to hide this kind of cone design inside the extension itself.

- if used with double door design, a lock mechanism is probably needed (3 legs vs 4 legs)

### [Fume filter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2105113)

[HEPA filter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5P4Q7B/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

Intake area should be at least 2x exhaust area. I have 5 holes 7cm in diameter in the bottom of enclosure

You should use a fan built for static pressure. I purchased a Corsair SP120 for this build though I haven't tested the filter yet as I'm redesigning it. I'll let you know how I get on. Static Pressure fans are perfect for water cooling radiators so the same should apply here. A standard fan is no where near as competent.

### [Temperature Control](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B019I3YCFS/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=athruz-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B019I3YCFS&linkId=ffac58c7a09452b0f169238dc409e6a3)

- 12V temperature controller
- can drive Fume extraction fan directly
