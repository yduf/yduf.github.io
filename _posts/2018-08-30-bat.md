> A cat(1) clone with wings. It has highlighting, paging, line numbers and git integration. - [Home](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) / [CLI: improved](https://remysharp.com/2018/08/23/cli-improved) - [\[HN\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17874718)

The bat command also allows me to search during output (only if the output is longer than the screen height) using the / key binding (similarly to less searching).

It can still be used like cat: "Whenever bat detects a non-interactive terminal, it will fall back to printing the plain file contents."
