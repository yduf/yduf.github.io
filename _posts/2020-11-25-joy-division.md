>just another one of my attempts at reproducing modern art with procedural generation and the HTML5 \<canvas\> element. This time I randomly generated images resembling the cover of the album by Joy Division called [“Unknown Pleasures”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vUDCZ6NePg). - [Unknown pleasures with JavaScript](https://maxhalford.github.io/blog/unknown-pleasures/)
