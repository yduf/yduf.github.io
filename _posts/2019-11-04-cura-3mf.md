3MF files can hold:
- More than one object in the scene
- the mesh itself not a [triangulated mesh](https://www.reddit.com/r/ender5/comments/pe491z/3mf_vs_stl/)
- Complete PrusaSlicer setup including:
   - Printer profile
      - Manually created supports
      - Variable layer height settings
      - Modificators
   - Scene units (STL objects are proportionless)
   - Color and texture information
   - Thumbnail (Can be changed to a photorealistic render for example)
