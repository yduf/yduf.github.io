> If you just go to the file menu and export, FreeCAD just creates a STL file from the visualisation mesh. The mesh tessellation was earlier simply defined from the FreeCAD PartDesign WB visualisation setting. 
> There was a feature request for on STL export to collect that value from the individual PartDesign "Body" objects' individual visualisation "property" rather than the FreeCAD setting value, which is what happens now IF we are talking about exporting a PartDesign Body object.
> If we are talking about Part WB objects, then the value is still collected from the PartDesign visualisation setting as previously explained. - [forum](https://forum.freecad.org/viewtopic.php?p=327958#p327958)
