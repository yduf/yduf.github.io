> I think what might be even more exciting to the general public is that a **10Gb Ethernet network** can be built for **under $40** and **connect two computers together**. In my case, it cost an additional **$80 to add a third computer**. A fourth computer would be even more expensive (8 total network interfaces, 6 total cables), so at this point it probably starts to make more sense to consider getting a switch. - [briancmoses.com](https://blog.briancmoses.com/2016/06/building-a-cost-conscious-faster-than-gigabit-network.html)
