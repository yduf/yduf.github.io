> The Kalman Filter is one of the most important and common estimation algorithms. The Kalman Filter produces estimates of hidden variables based on inaccurate and uncertain measurements. Also, the Kalman Filter predicts the future system state based on past estimations. - [kalmanfilter.net](https://www.kalmanfilter.net/default.aspx)

**System state** - input needed for the prediction algorithm
**Dynamic Model** - the relation between input and output
**Measurement Noise** + **Process Noise**
