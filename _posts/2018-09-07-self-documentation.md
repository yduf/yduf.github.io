> Self-documenting code is one of the biggest documentation myths in the software industry. This view generally conflates documentation with code comments. - [“My Code is Self-Documenting”](http://ericholscher.com/blog/2017/jan/27/code-is-self-documenting/)

I’d like to make two arguments in this post:
- Code comments have value,
- Documentation has more value than just explaining how software works.

**Code comments document the why, not the how.** They are important to transfer knowledge to both people reading the code or developers working on the code.

**Object names document the how, not the why.**
 
## Documentation is more than code comments
The other fatal flaw of the “self-documenting code” mindset is that it is myopic. It takes a developer-only point of view, only seeing the value of documentation as allowing people to understand how code works. **Documentation is for every possible user.**
