## [Template customization](https://remarkablewiki.com/tips/templates)

The templates in the list show up in the order they are listed on the json, so if you want to change the order they show up, just change the order they are listed in. - [Tired of trying to find custom templates? Just added a new category in the JSON file!](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/jr9jn3/tired_of_trying_to_find_custom_templates_just/)

- [How do I change the template for an existing notebook? (all pages at once)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemarkableTablet/comments/i5gg4b/notebook_template/)

If developing a custom template, the .png file is the image shown when drawing on the remarkable device. The .svg vector file will be used when exporting the template to .pdf via the USB web interface (Enabled under Storage Settings). Both templates must be in the exact resolution of 1404Ã—1872 pixels regardless of whether the template is intended for portrait or landscape mode.

> This is essentially the state of the market right now, the tradeoff is between a reMarkable which has a much more limited featureset, but what it does, it does really well (consistent and intuitive UX, low latency writing, great palm rejection).
> 
> Then you have the Onyx Boox, which thanks to its Android underpinnings, offers a lot more power in terms of broader functionality, additional apps and document support, a lot of configurability, and a somewhat familiar interface for Android users. When you spread the peanut butter over a wider surface, it's thinner throughout, and so along with that broader functionality is a lot more inconsistent (and frankly, insane UX), UX that is clear it's built for dual Chinese and Intl markets with random instances of Chinese hardcoded to menus, and the list goes on. - [r/Onyx_Boox](https://www.reddit.com/r/Onyx_Boox/comments/kaegqd/i_bought_a_boox_note_to_take_notes_and_annotate/gf9wybo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
