Sort covered:
- [sorting small arrays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJTYQYB1JQ&t=600s) - up to 15 elements
	- sorted hundreds of elements fast.
		- binary sort is always worse than linear insertion sort - because of bad branch predictability (50% success) vs (87.5% for linear search).
		- branchless binary search is even slower - ?
		- Middle-out Insertion Sort - start in the middle - grow & sort on both end. - not significant difference
	- [How about try silly things (since clever things have not work so far)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJTYQYB1JQ&t=1452s)
		- [stupid_small_sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJTYQYB1JQ&t=1505s) - make_heap + insertion_sort - by doing more work
			- smoothsort, many comparisons still predictable
			- fewer swaps
		- remove comparison for heap / this what make it faster
        
Other take away:
- qsort is good for big arrays, terrible for small arrays (so in general rely on other sort for small arrays (see [THRESHOLD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJJTYQYB1JQ&t=432s))
