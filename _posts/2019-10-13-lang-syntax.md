title: Syntax matters

> Programming language experts like to claim that syntax doesn't matter, that semantics is all that counts. Don't believe them! They're overrotating on a common, pre-rigorous misunderstanding of language design as superficially aesthetic. The study of semantics does provide deep insights into the mechanics of languagesâ€”but the mechanism is not the mental model. Design requires engaging with the way people express their programs, and syntax is a "tool of thought". - [Stroustrup's Rule and Layering Over Time](https://thefeedbackloop.xyz/stroustrups-rule-and-layering-over-time/)
