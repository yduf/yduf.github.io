- [ Options for Debugging Your Program](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Debugging-Options.html) - at least use `-g`

### [CMake](https://chat.openai.com/c/8bffe132-a718-4d6b-84b6-265d1601042e)
Edit Your CMakeLists.txt: Open the CMakeLists.txt file in the root directory of your project using a text editor.

Add Debug Information Flags: To include debug information, you typically need to add compiler flags. These flags can vary depending on your compiler, but common flags include:
`set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -g")`

Reconfigure Your Build: After making changes to the CMakeLists.txt file, you need to reconfigure your build. You can do this by running the following commands in your project's build directory: `cmake ..`

Recompile Your Program: After reconfiguring, you should recompile your program. This will rebuild it with the added debug information: `make`
