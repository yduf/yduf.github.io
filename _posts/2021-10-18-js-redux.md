> a library to manage state globally - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

- single source of truth
- state is read only
- changes using pure function (create a new state)

Can work independantly or with react.js

Use Flux Pattern (one way dataflow):
Action -> Dispatcher -> Store -> View

vs MVC (Model View Controller)
Action -> Controller **=>** Model **<->** Views (why the view would modify the model?)
