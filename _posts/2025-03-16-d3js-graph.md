> Efficient and usable graph display with 1'000 Nodes. A story about [tags](tags/) visualisation.

## Context

This my [Bookmarks / blog](/about), to organize thing, historically I was relying only on post title, then I used the most simplest form of jekyll tags (wihtout using any plugins) so this can still be hosted on github.

Here I am exploring how/if I can make sense of all this tags accumulated all these years, and see the relationship between them. At least that how it started.

### [d3-force](https://d3js.org/d3-force)

This d3 module implements an auto-layout modee for displaying complex graph. It's what I choose to use as a starter for the tag graph (didn't consider other tool).

[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/share/67d4209c-94f0-800d-9cb2-b38c22a052e7) was able to quicly write down a working solution, which I manage to fit with my jekyll constraint.

Because of the number of nodes (~1'000) and dense relation between them (which was a surpise), the tool has a hardtime making things stand out.

So additionnal work is needed
- to make the page more responsive
- to make it more usable


This is what we explore here.
