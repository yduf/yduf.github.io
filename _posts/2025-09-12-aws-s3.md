- [	An intro to DeepSeek's distributed file system (3FS)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43716058) - Architecturally, it is a scale-out metadata filesystem[^1]. Other related distributed file systems are Collosus, Tectonic (Meta), ADLSv2 (Microsoft), HopsFS (Hopsworks), and I think PolarFS (Alibaba). They all use different distributed row-oriented DBs for storing metadata. S3FS uses FoundationDB, Collosus uses BigTable, Tectonic some KV store, ADLSv2 (not sure), HopsFS uses RonDB.
