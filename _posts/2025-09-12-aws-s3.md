- [ZeroFS, the Filesystem That Makes S3 Your Primary Storage ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45174724)

- [	An intro to DeepSeek's distributed file system (3FS)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43716058) - Architecturally, it is a scale-out metadata filesystem[^1]. Other related distributed file systems are Collosus, Tectonic (Meta), ADLSv2 (Microsoft), HopsFS (Hopsworks), and I think PolarFS (Alibaba). They all use different distributed row-oriented DBs for storing metadata. S3FS uses FoundationDB, Collosus uses BigTable, Tectonic some KV store, ADLSv2 (not sure), HopsFS uses RonDB.

- [Replacing EBS and Rethinking Postgres Storage from First Principles](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45748484)
  - EBS costs for allocation
  - EBS is slow at restores from snapshot (faster to spin up a database from a Postgres backup stored in S3 than from an EBS snapshot in S3)
  - EBS only lets you attach 24 volumes per instance
  - EBS only lets you resize once every 6–24 hours, you can't shrink or adjust continuously
  - Detaching and reattaching EBS volumes can take 10s for healthy volumes to 20m for failed ones, so failover takes longer
