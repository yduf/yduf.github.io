> Installing a regular Linux distribution on an Android device opens a whole new world of possibilities. You can turn your Android device into a full-blown Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP server and run web-based applications on it, install and use your favorite Linux tools, and even run a graphical desktop environment. - [Linux Mag](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Convert-an-Android-Device-to-Linux)

### [Linux Deploy](https://github.com/meefik/linuxdeploy)
### [ UserLAnd](https://www.androidauthority.com/install-ubuntu-on-your-android-smartphone-765408/)

Userland is an app to help you set up a container and run applications in it quickly using proot,likes desktop environment Same with what Linux deploy (same with userland but using chroot not proot) did,but proot doesn't need your phone to be rooted because it doesn't need root authority.

Closed source / payed option.
