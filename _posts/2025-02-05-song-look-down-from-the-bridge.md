That song played for Morty when he realized nothing will be the same
The same song played for Rick when he realized everything is still the same

Morty realized that his mundane concerns (high school, bullies, girls, even his family to a certain extent) that his life was limited to ceased to exist in a few seconds and the world went on as if nothing had happened, so As he told Summer, worrying so much about it was a mistake.  

Rick spent so many years resenting life and obsessed with catching Rick Prime that he couldn't see his mistake until he killed him.
