> Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies). - [github](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui#dear-imgui) / [demo](https://pthom.github.io/imgui_manual_online/manual/imgui_manual.html) / [2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/ocornut/imgui/web/v167/v167-misc.png)

### Starter

With [Meson]({% post_url 2020-08-12-build-meson %})
use the Wrap to simplify your life:

{% highlight bash %}
$ meson wrap install imgui
$ meson build .
{% endhighlight %}

And the following [main.cpp](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/tree/master/examples/example_sdl2_sdlrenderer2) _SDL2 (Win32, Mac, Linux, etc.) + SDL_Renderer for SDL2_

## [About the IMGUI paradigm](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm)

Dear ImGui is one possible implementation of an idea generally described as the IMGUI ([**Immediate Mode GUI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics))) paradigm. The Immediate Mode GUI paradigm may at first appear unusual to some users. This is mainly because ["**Retained Mode**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode) GUIs have been so widespread and predominant. [The following links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSRJ1jZq90k) can give you a better understanding about how Immediate Mode GUIs works.

### [Immediate Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics))
- the client calls directly cause rendering of graphics objects to the display, or in which
- the data to describe rendering primitives is inserted frame by frame directly from the client into a command list (in the case of immediate mode primitive rendering),without the use of extensive indirection - thus _immediate_ - to retained resources.

### [Retained Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode)
- the graphics library, instead of the client, retains the scene (complete object model of the rendering primitives) to be rendered and
- the client calls into the graphics library do not directly cause actual rendering, but make use of extensive indirection to resources, managed – thus _retained_ – by the graphics library.
