> Dear ImGui is a bloat-free graphical user interface library for C++. It outputs optimized vertex buffers that you can render anytime in your 3D-pipeline enabled application. It is fast, portable, renderer agnostic and self-contained (no external dependencies). - [ocornut/imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)

## [About the IMGUI paradigm](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki#about-the-imgui-paradigm)

Dear ImGui is one possible implementation of an idea generally described as the IMGUI ([**Immediate Mode GUI**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics))) paradigm. The Immediate Mode GUI paradigm may at first appear unusual to some users. This is mainly because ["**Retained Mode**"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode) GUIs have been so widespread and predominant. [The following links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSRJ1jZq90k) can give you a better understanding about how Immediate Mode GUIs works.

### [Immediate Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediate_mode_(computer_graphics))
- the client calls directly cause rendering of graphics objects to the display, or in which
- the data to describe rendering primitives is inserted frame by frame directly from the client into a command list (in the case of immediate mode primitive rendering),without the use of extensive indirection - thus _immediate_ - to retained resources.

### [Retained Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retained_mode)
- the graphics library, instead of the client, retains the scene (complete object model of the rendering primitives) to be rendered and
- the client calls into the graphics library do not directly cause actual rendering, but make use of extensive indirection to resources, managed – thus _retained_ – by the graphics library.

### [Crystal](https://github.com/oprypin/crystal-imgui)
    
Installation
- [Install CrSFML](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml#installation)
	- [install SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-linux.php) `sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`
- [Install crystal-imgui-sfml](https://github.com/oprypin/crystal-imgui-sfml)
	- using shard in a [new project]({% post_url 2017-08-30-crystal %}) 
    	- `crystal init app gui_app`
        - add depedencies
        - `shards install`

[Trying the example](https://github.com/oprypin/crystal-imgui-sfml#building-a-project)
{% highlight bash %}
cd lib/imgui-sfml/
crystal build examples/simple.cr

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)"
./simple
{% endhighlight %}
