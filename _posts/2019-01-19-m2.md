> [M.2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2) is interesting not just because it can speed up storage with PCI Express lanes, but because it can use a whole bunch of different buses too; it stands to replace both mSATA and mini PCI Express, two older standards that have been used for SSDs and Wi-Fi cards in laptops for a while now. Intel's new Broadwell CPUs and their chipsets include native support for M.2 and PCI Express boot driversâ€”neither PCIe-connected storage (hi Apple) nor the M.2 connector itself are new, but beginning with Broadwell systems each of those two things will become much more common. -  [Understanding M.2](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/02/understanding-m-2-the-interface-that-will-speed-up-your-next-ssd/)

## key / type
- **A** - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, cellular cards 
- **B** - SATA and PCIe x2 SSDs
- **E** - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, cellular cards
- **M** - PCIe x4 SSDs
