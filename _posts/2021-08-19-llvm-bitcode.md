> LLVM provides both a textual form that looks roughly like a C-family programming language, and a binary form (bitcode, in LLVM’s parlance) that’s denser and (ostensibly) faster to parse. The two forms are semantically identical, and trivial to produce and convert between. - [the bitcode format](https://blog.yossarian.net/2021/07/19/LLVM-internals-part-1-bitcode-format)
