> Wolfenstein 3D is a big milestone in id Software’s evolution and PC gaming in general. In addition, because its technology is more primitive, the source code is more approachable for study and implementation. The game doesn’t have a real 3D engine but rather simulates a 3D world from a 2D map using a technique called Ray Casting. All the drawing is done by directly putting pixels on the screen. - [Rustenstein 3D: Game programming like it's 1992](https://tech.nextroll.com/blog/dev/2022/02/02/rustenstein.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30182565)
