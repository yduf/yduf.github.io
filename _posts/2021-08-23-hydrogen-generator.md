**make sure not to use table salt NaCl. Unless you want to make chlorine gas.... ** 

**stainless steel should NOT be used as electrodes.  Using them for extended periods contaminates your electrolyte with nasty carcinogenic hexavalent chromium ions from the steel.  You'll see the electrolyte turn yellowish and often cloudy.  I'm sure the pH has something to do with how much Cr+6 you get, so maybe KOH is just fine.  But I know from experience that you will get Cr+6 in solution if you use baking soda.  Don't just dump that yellow electrolyte down the drain -- it's toxic waste.** - [DIY Hydrogen/Oxygen Generators](https://prose.io/#yduf/yduf.github.io/edit/master/_posts/2021-08-23-hydrogen-generator.md)

Finally, Dharmaraj et al. claim to be able to reduce the power consumption from 18 W to 0.57 W using 200 ns pulses at 100 MHz, while keeping the produced gas rate constant [30]. Using a MOSFET driver circuit, Demir et al. applied square pulses up to 1200 kHz achieving a 20e25% lower energy consumption for 50% duty cycles, compared to DC current [21]. - [list](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257919603_Economical_Hydrogen_Production_by_Electrolysis_Using_Nano_Pulsed_DC)
