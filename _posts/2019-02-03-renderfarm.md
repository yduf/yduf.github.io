> The [Helmer](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/categories/departments/workspaces/10711/) filing cabinet from IKEA serves as the perfect enclosure for a small farm. It's actually kind of bizarre how well it houses all the components. And you can pick one of these up for $40 - and even in a few different colors. I feel like RED or YELLOW would make your farm run at least 2% faster - [blender tutorial](https://cgcookie.com/tutorial/setting-up-a-renderfarm/)
