> a pointer algorithm that uses only two pointers, which move through the sequence at different speeds. - [Cycle detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection)

[There are 3 steps:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare)
- find if cycle exists
- find position of first repetition
- find cycle length

see [rosettacode.org](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Ruby)

[Brent's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Brent's_algorithm) use a faster model with progressive speed.
