> .zip is an archive format using, usually, the Deflate compression method. The .gz gzip format is for single files, also using the Deflate compression method. The zlib library provides Deflate compression and decompression code for use by zip, gzip, png (which uses the zlib wrapper on deflate data), and many other applications. - [Mark Adler (SO)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/20765054/51386)

### lib
- [zlib-ng](https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng?tab=readme-ov-file#zlib-ng) - zlib data compression library for the next generation systems 
	- The motivation for this fork was seeing several 3rd party contributions with new optimizations not getting implemented into the official zlib repository.
