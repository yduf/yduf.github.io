> I want to highlight a localization algorithm I came up with which works really well, at least in this specific setting. I’ve been using it in races for a while and it really stepped up the speeds I was able to achieve without the car getting “lost” – about 22mph on the front straight of this small track. - [Fast indoor 2D localization using ceiling lights](https://www.a1k0n.net/2021/01/22/indoor-localization.html)
