> Lua is a lightweight embeddable scripting language that is commonly used in a variety of applications. Because Lua has C bindings, it is very easy to embed. As a result of this, Lua is widely used in many applications(especially games). - [Reversing Luaâ€™s C API](https://colton1skees.github.io/posts/LuaReversal.html)

- [LuaDec](https://github.com/viruscamp/luadec) - a Lua decompiler for lua 5.1 , and experimental for lua 5.2 and 5.3.
- [unluac ](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unluac/) -  a decompiler for Lua 5.0 through 5.4. It runs on Lua chunks that have been compiled with the standard Lua compiler. It requires that debugging information has not been stripped from the chunk.
