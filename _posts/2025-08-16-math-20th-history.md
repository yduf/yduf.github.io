> several key themes that have characterised mathematics in the 20th century. The impact of physics is also discussed, and some speculations are made about possible developments in the 21st century. - [pdf](https://marktomforde.com/academic/miscellaneous/images/atiyah20thcentury.pdf) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42989419)

# [Key Themes Highlighted by Atiyah](https://chatgpt.com/share/68a0993f-9e9c-800d-87ca-ea8b953ecaf6)

1. From the Local to the Global

Atiyah emphasizes a fundamental shift during the 20th century—from focusing on local, explicit investigations to embracing global, qualitative structures. Examples include:

    Complex analysis: moving beyond power-series expressions to studying functions via their global aspects, like singularities and domains.

    Differential equations: from explicit local solutions to understanding global behavior in terms of singularities.

    Differential geometry: evolving from local curvature computations (à la Gauss) to exploring the large-scale topology of manifolds.

    Number theory: the interplay between local (individual primes) and global perspectives.

    Physics: inherently concerns scaling behavior from local differential laws to global phenomena.

2. Rise of Higher Dimensions

There was a dramatic move from the familiar lower-dimensional settings to much higher—even infinite—dimensional contexts:

    Complex variables: expansion from one variable to multi-variable theory, introducing entirely new phenomena.

    Geometry: from tangible curves and surfaces to abstract, high-dimensional manifolds.

    Analysis: development of infinite-dimensional spaces (e.g., Hilbert spaces) and functionals such as those in the calculus of variations.

3. From Commutative to Non-commutative Structures

Atiyah notes the growing prominence of non-commutative algebra:

    Rooted in Hamilton’s quaternions and Grassmann’s exterior algebra.

    Now central in areas like operator algebras and quantum theory.
