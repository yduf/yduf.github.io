  - it’s self-contained: it works without dependencies, and with the hardware it was designed for
  - there’s an ongoing need: peope want to continue playing Space Invaders
  - it’s transposable: the environment it runs in can be recreated through additional layers (emulators here)
  - it’s recreatable: the core concepts behind Space Invaders can be reimplemented in the prevailing contexts of the time
