> _nCr_ a selection of items from a set that has distinct members, such that the order of selection does not matter (unlike permutations). - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination) / [calculator](https://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/combinations.php)

5 C 3 = 10: 3 elements subsets of 5 elements set

### [Combinatorial Number system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_number_system)

The combinatorial number system of degree k (for some positive integer k), also referred to as combinadics, or the Macaulay representation of an integer, is a correspondence between natural numbers (taken to include 0) N and k-combinations, represented as strictly decreasing sequences ck > ... > c2 > c1 â‰¥ 0. Since the latter are strings of numbers, one can view this as a kind of numeral system for representing N, although the main utility is representing a k-combination by N rather than the other way around. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct k-combinations, and produce them in lexicographic order

This can be seen as a kind of perfect hash for certain situation.
