- ~~Works perfectly with Wine~~
	- was working perfectly with system 8.0.2 under Lutris
    - but now graphic are messed up (no gl texture?)
    	- does not seems to be a driver issue => work the same with intel or nvidia
        - maybe a DXVK issue, since last kernel / update
        - happened in a strange way / don't know what was change on the system

### [Helpful Tips and Tricks](https://www.gamezebo.com/walkthroughs/bleak-sword-guide-tips-cheats-and-strategies/)
- This game is base upon counterattack (parry + attack).
	- You can’t parry all attacks
	- When an exclamation mark appears over an attack, that’s a good sign that the enemy can’t be parried.
- You don’t have to attack the enemy you blocked while parrying
- Use consumables when you need them
