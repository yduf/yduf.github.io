> Human beings live in a state of mind called 'sanity' on a small planet in space. They are not quite sure whether the space around them is infinite or not (either way it is unthinkable). If they think about time, they find it inconceivable that it had a beginning. It is also inconceivable that it did not have a beginning. Thoughts of this kind are not disturbing to 'sanity', which is obviously a remarkable phenomenon and deserving more recognition. - [The Human Evasion](http://www.theabsolute.net/minefield/humevas.html) - [\[HN\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19925859)
