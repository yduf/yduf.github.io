> SectorC  is a C compiler written in x86-16 assembly that fits within the 512 byte boot sector of an x86 machine. It supports a subset of C that is large enough to write real and interesting programs. It is quite likely the smallest C compiler ever written. - [xorvoid](https://xorvoid.com/sectorc.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36064971)
