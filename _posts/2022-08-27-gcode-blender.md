If you have the 3d model because you made it it doesn't make sense to animate it with a gcode scripts when a slice plane is a fraction of the resources.

Also the animation here is clearly a slice plane an not gcode and the plane is perfectly flatnon top and just gradually grows up in infinite small increments with the framerate.

The gcode stuff is just used to create the internal structure.
