## ACPI Event
{% highlight bash %}
acpi_listen
{% endhighlight %}

## [Backlight](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Backlight)
{% highlight bash %}
$ ls /sys/class/backlight/

# echo 4000 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
{% endhighlight %}

## [Debugging Kernel Suspend](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingKernelSuspend)

In order to simulate your suspend/resume process, enter the following commands: 

{% highlight bash %}
sudo sh -c "sync && echo 1 > /sys/power/pm_trace && pm-suspend"
{% endhighlight %}

At this point your computer should enter the suspend state within a few seconds. Usually the power LED will slowly flash when in the suspended state. When that has happened, initiate the resume process by pressing the power button. Observe closely if the disk light comes on briefly. This indicates that resume has begun. If resume fails to complete, then press the power button until the computer turns off. Power on your computer making sure that it loads the same kernel that exhibited the resume problem. You have about 3 minutes to start this boot process before the information saved in the RTC gets corrupted.

Start a console and enter: 

{% highlight bash %}
dmesg > dmesg.txt

## [Patching ACPI tables](https://github.com/ivzave/matebook-linux#patching-acpi-tables)

- [acpidump](https://www.mankier.com/1/acpidump) / [acpixtract](https://www.mankier.com/1/acpixtract#)

First extract tables:
{% highlight bash %}
acpidump > acpidump.hex
acpixtract -a acpidump.hex
{% endhighlight %}

Alternative way to extract table [through kernel](https://www.reddit.com/r/SurfaceLinux/comments/46o3mh/fix_udev_power_adapter_event_by_patching_acpi/):
{% highlight bash %}
cat /sys/firmware/acpi/tables/DSDT > dsdt.dat
{% endhighlight %}


Decompile tables with [iasl](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-iasl/) / [doc](https://acpica.org/sites/acpica/files/aslcompiler.pdf) / [Fork of Intel's iasl](https://github.com/RehabMan/Intel-iasl)

{% highlight bash %}
iasl -fe refs.txt -da dsdt.dat ssdt*.dat
{% endhighlight %}

### [DSDT](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/DSDT)
Differentiated System Description Table supplies information about supported power events in a given system.
