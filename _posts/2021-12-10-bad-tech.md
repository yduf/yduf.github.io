> The true meaning of "materialism" is quite the opposite of how we use it today. A materialist was someone who loved and appreciated material, for example, a carpenter who loved wood and knew all the cuts and grains of various timbers. Today we use the word to mean someone who has a toxic, disprespectful relation with the material world, based on shallow ownership. - [Bad tech is a class issue. ](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/techno-clutter-farnell.html).
