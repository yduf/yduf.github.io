> These motors come in a variety of flavors, from the four-wire deals you find in 3D printer builds, to motors with five or six wires. Unipolar motors – the ones with more than four wires – are easier to control, but are severely limited in generating torque. Luckily, [you can use any unipolar motor as a more efficient bipolar motor](http://www.jangeox.be/2013/10/change-unipolar-28byj-48-to-bipolar.html) with a simple xacto knife modification. - [hackaday.com](https://hackaday.com/2014/07/29/changing-unipolar-steppers-to-bipolar/)
