- [Backdoor in upstream xz/liblzma leading to SSH server compromise](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39865810) - The upstream xz repository and the xz tarballs have been backdoored.
	- the apparent author of the backdoor... has been part of the xz project for 2 years... and to be honest with this level of sophistication I would be suspicious of even older versions of xz until proven otherwise. 

 - (1) safe interoperability among xz implementations is not guaranteed; 
 - (2) xz's extensibility is unreasonable and problematic; 
 - (3) xz is vulnerable to unprotected flags and length fields;
 - (4) LZMA2 is unsafe and less efficient than the original LZMA; 
 - (5) xz includes useless features that increase the number of false positives for corruption; 
 - (6) xz shows inconsistent behavior with respect to trailing data; 
 - (7) error detection in xz is several times less accurate than in bzip2, gzip and lzip.
