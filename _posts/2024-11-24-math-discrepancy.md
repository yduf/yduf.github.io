> a measurement of the highest or lowest density of points in a sequence. High discrepancy means that there is either a large area of empty space, or that there is an area that has a high density of points. Low discrepancy means that there are neither, and that your points are more or less pretty evenly distributed. - [When Random Numbers Are Too Random](https://blog.demofox.org/2017/05/29/when-random-numbers-are-too-random-low-discrepancy-sequences/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38905280)
