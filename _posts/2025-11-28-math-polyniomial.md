$\mathbb{C}$ is algeabraically closed - _What happens on the complex plane stay on the complex plane_

There is no function that take coefficient and gives solution and is continuous.

And so can not be written with basic algrebra (indeed quadratic formula use $\pm$)

Square root can be extend to riemann surface for continuity (that returns 2 value opposite to each other).

Commutators
- 2 roots - uneeded
- 3 roots - 1 commutators
- 4 roots - more
- 5 roots (quintics) - 2x 3cycles - that connect in center - there is no finite number of nested roots (sqr) and cannot be expressed by commutators.
	- There is no algrebric formulla that solve quintics
