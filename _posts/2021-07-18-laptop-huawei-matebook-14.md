## Startup options
- F2 - BIOS access
- F10 - windows restore
- [F12](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us00693076/) - boot select

## [Factory partition](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatebookXPro/comments/9xnhe1/partitioning_on_a_new_device/)
- System (120Go) - Windows 10 (C:)
- Data   (341Go) - D:
- WINPE  (.5GB) - WinPE is a preinstallation environment that lets you install Windows from a wim file... probably from the 14gb key partition.
- WinRE  (1GB) - WinRE is a recovery environment for restoring Windows in the event it fails to boot. 
- [OneKey](https://www.reddit.com/r/MatebookXPro/comments/fdr566/matebook_d_is_huaweis_system_restore_partition/) (14GB) -  Huawei laptops have two system restore modes, one that is built in to Windows 10 and one made [by Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/content/en-us00692605/)

That said, technically you dont need any of them. You can just create a Windows 10 usb installer and download your drivers separately and store them on the usb drive in a folder, then format your ssd and reinstall Windows. That will free up your 14gb partition - since that probably houses the stock image of the hard drive that can be restored through WinPE. With your windows installer on a usb stick instead, you’ll get the standard Windows install: an efi partition, a recovery partion, and the rest of your space to your C drive. Though you’ll have to find your serial or a way to transfer the activation license with you.

## [Installing Linux](https://www.tecmint.com/install-linux-mint-alongside-windows-dual-boot-uefi-mode/)

### Shrink/Delete Partition
Using disk management tool
- remove Data (D:) partition 
- shrink OS (C:) partition to 50Go (leave 10Go free)

For the moment leave Onekey partition (14Go occupied)

### Linux install
Internet connection is recommanded for install (for thirdparty software).

Partition / (100Go), /home (300Go)
