> This article is a guide to using screws in 3D printed SLA parts. There are many other ways [to attach multiple 3D printed parts](https://formlabs.com/blog/how-to-create-models-larger-than-your-3d-printers-build-volume/)  together, but if you need to repeatedly attach and detach components and want robust mechanical fastening, there's no real replacement for genuine metal threads. -  [Adding Screw Threads to 3D Printed Parts](https://formlabs.com/blog/adding-screw-threads-3d-printed-parts/)

## [Freecad]({% post_url 2020-05-29-freecad %})

Freecad knows ISO screws size - see [Fasterner Workbench](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Fasteners_Workbench)

And 0.20 can make hole with thread.

### [Creating thread](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?t=41892)

Cutting a thread with bolt gives you a "negative" bolt thread which is mechanically incorrect.
To make a "real" threaded hole, there is a special arbitrary length "tap" rod that you then cut from your object:

 If it is made for 3D printing, there is a section in the settings that lets you tweak tolerances such that printed parts will match each other.



### For tapped screw hole,

when creating holes in part-design workbench
- select _ISO metric regular profile_
- select _Size_ (ex M3)
- select  _Threaded_ => this will give a hole diameter for tap drill (ex for [M3 screw, it's 2.5mm](https://www.thingiverse.com/groups/sunhokey-3d-printer-owners/forums/general/topic:5484#comment-838622))

## Openscad
### [undersized holes](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/The_OpenSCAD_Language#cylinder)

When using cylinder() with difference() to place holes in objects, the holes will be undersized. This is because circular paths are approximated with polygons inscribed within in a circle. The points of the polygon are on the circle, but straight lines between are inside.
