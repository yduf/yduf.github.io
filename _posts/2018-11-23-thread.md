> In many environments, multi-threaded code is written in a language that  was  originally  designed  without  thread  support  (e.g.  C),  to which  a  library  of  threading  primitives  was  subsequently  added. There appears to be a general understanding that this is not the right
approach.  We  provide  specific  arguments  that  a  pure  library approach, in which the compiler is designed independently of threading issues, cannot guarantee correctness of the resulting code. -  [Cannot Be Implemented As a Library (Boehm)](https://cs.nyu.edu/~mwalfish/classes/14fa/ref/boehm05threads.pdf)

## C++
> "Effort to revise the C++ language standard to better accommodate threads" was eventually achieved in C++11, which uses a separate type for atomic variables (std::atomic) rather than relying on volatile, and has a formal memory model with a variety of memory orderings of different strengths (relaxed, acquire/release, sequentially consistent). - [\[HN\]](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18483717)
