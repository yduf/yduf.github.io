> The algorithmic trick that solves Rubik’s Cubes and breaks ciphers - [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL3uWO-KLUE)

Has been used to break DES (56bits key).
So the creation of Trible DES (112bits key).

For solving rubik cube:
Need to explorer 10¹⁰ x2 state instead of 10²⁰. Which may be achievable (in days).
