## [Mac startup key combinations](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201255)

Key combinations for an Intel-based Mac

**Command (⌘)-R**: Start up from the built-in macOS Recovery system. Or use Option-Command-R or Shift-Option-Command-R to start up from macOS Recovery over the internet. macOS Recovery installs different versions of macOS, depending on the key combination you use. 

**Option (⌥) or Alt**: Start up to Startup Manager, which allows you to choose other available startup disks or volumes. 

**Option-Command-P-R**: Reset NVRAM or PRAM.

**Shift (⇧)**:  Start up in safe mode. 

**D**: Start up to the Apple Diagnostics utility. Or use Option-D to start up to this utility over the internet.

**N**: Start up from a NetBoot server, if your Mac supports network startup volumes. To use the default boot image on the server, press and hold Option-N instead. 

**Command-S**: Start up in single-user mode. Disabled in macOS Mojave or later.

**T**: Start up in target disk mode.

**Command-V**: Start up in verbose mode. 

**Eject (⏏) or F12 or mouse button or trackpad button**: Eject removable media, such as an optical disc.
