> I decided to adapt
my course notes into a how-to, to get you to a cool program as quickly as possible. It will not be
a full-featured ray tracer, but it does have the indirect lighting which has made ray tracing a
staple in movies. Follow these steps, and the architecture of the ray tracer you produce will be
good for extending to a more extensive ray tracer if you get excited and want to pursue that. - [Peter Shirley](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25244301)
