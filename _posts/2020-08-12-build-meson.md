> The main design point of Meson is that every moment a developer spends writing or debugging build definitions is a second wasted. So is every second spent waiting for the build system to actually start compiling code. - [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/index.html)

## [Compiling a Meson project](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#compiling-a-meson-project)

The only thing to note is that you need to create a separate build directory. Meson will not allow you to build source code inside your source tree. All build artifacts are stored in the build directory.

### [meson.build](https://mesonbuild.com/Tutorial.html) file
{% highlight bash %}
$ mkdir test && cd test && meson init
$ meson build && cd build
$ meson compile
$ meson test
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
project('tutorial', 'c')
gtkdep = dependency('gtk+-3.0')
executable('demo', 'main.c', dependencies : gtkdep)
{% endhighlight %}

## [Subprojects](https://mesonbuild.com/Subprojects.html)

Meson allows you to take any other Meson project and make it a part of your build without (in the best case) any changes to its Meson setup. It becomes a transparent part of the project.

[CMake based subprojects](https://mesonbuild.com/CMake-module.html#cmake-subprojects) are also supported but not guaranteed to work.

[Wrap file](https://mesonbuild.com/Wrap-dependency-system-manual.html) tells Meson how to download it for you. If you then use this subproject in your build, Meson will automatically download and extract it during build. This makes subproject embedding extremely easy. see also [Wrap DB](https://wrapdb.mesonbuild.com/)

## [Cross compilation](https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html)
Meson requires you to write a [cross build definition file](https://mesonbuild.com/Cross-compilation.html#cross-file-locations). It defines various properties of the cross build environment. The cross file consists of different sections.

Let's suppose you are on a 64 bit OSX machine and you are cross compiling a binary that will run on a 32 bit ARM Linux board. In this case your build machine is 64 bit OSX, your host machine is 32 bit ARM Linux and your target machine is irrelevant (but defaults to the same value as the host machine).

### ARM Cross compilation
your `host_machine` is [ARM](https://mesonbuild.com/Reference-tables.html#cpu-families) Linux

{% highlight ruby %}
# ~/.local/share/meson/cross/remarkable
# meson builddir/ --cross-file remarkable
[host_machine]               
system = 'linux'             
cpu_family = 'arm'           
cpu = 'armv7l'            
endian = 'little'
{% endhighlight %}

## Tipical build
{% highlight bash %}
$ meson build .  (1)
$ cd build
$ ninja build    (2)
$ ninja test     (3)
{% endhighlight %}

1. First time you configure the project
2. Each time you build it
3. Each time you run tests

## Features
- multiplatform support for Linux, macOS, Windows, GCC, Clang, Visual Studio and others
- supported languages include C, C++, D, Fortran, Java, Rust
- build definitions in a very readable and user friendly non-Turing complete DSL
- cross compilation for many operating systems as well as bare metal
optimized for extremely fast full and incremental builds without sacrificing correctness
- built-in multiplatform dependency provider that works together with distro packages
