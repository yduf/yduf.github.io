[Dolphin supports playing games dumped in the following formats](https://dolphin-emu.org/docs/faq/):

GCM/ISO (uncompressed dumps, should be 1.4GB for GameCube games and 4.7GB for Wii games  
GCZ (Dolphin can be used to compress your games to this format)  
CISO*  
WBFS* (not supported in Dolphin 3.0 or earlier)

Note that WBFS and CISO are lossy compression formats: they remove some of the unused information stored on the discs to make files smaller. As such, we recommend you try dumping your games as GCM/ISO if you get issues using a WBFS dump.
