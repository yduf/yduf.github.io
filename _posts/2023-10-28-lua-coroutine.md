> Want to spice up your game with animated scene between bouts of gameplay? Cutscenes are uncommon on small platforms like PICO-8. There's no room for full motion video, so a scene must be described in code or with some kind of cutscene engine. This is made much easier with a Lua feature added in PICO-8 v0.1.6: coroutines. - [CutscenesAndCoroutines](https://pico-8.fandom.com/wiki/CutscenesAndCoroutines)
