> A graphical and themeable emulator front-end that allows you to access all your favorite games in one place, even without a keyboard! - [Home](https://www.emulationstation.org) / [github](https://github.com/Aloshi/EmulationStation) / [r/emulationstation](https://www.reddit.com/r/emulationstation/)

ArkOS is using [EmulationStation FCAMOD](https://github.com/christianhaitian/EmulationStation-fcamod)

### [Configuration](https://github.com/christianhaitian/EmulationStation-fcamod#configuring)

ES will check two places for an es_systems.cfg file, in the following order, stopping after it finds one that works:

- ~/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg
- /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg  <= the one used on ArkOS
