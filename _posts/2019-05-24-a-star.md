> A* is a modification of [Dijkstra’s Algorithm]({% post_url 2021-07-03-algorithm-disjkstra %}) that is optimized for **a single destination**. Dijkstra’s Algorithm can find paths to all locations; A* finds paths to one location, **or the closest of several locations**. It prioritizes paths that seem to be leading closer to a goal. - [Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) / [Introduction to A*](http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html)
