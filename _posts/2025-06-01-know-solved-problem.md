	- In math, we are finite beings trying to apprehend the infinite
    - The Busy Beaver function actually quantifies that (!)
    - Even the finite can exceed the scope of the cosmos. That's where we need physics and complexity theory
    - Quantum computers look like they're already slightly expanding the scope of what mathematical statements we can know
    - Can we know even more than that? Depends what the ultimate laws of physics are
