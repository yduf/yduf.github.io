- [UUIDv1 is generally not recommended since it leaks MAC addresses](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39258654) - people have been pwn'd due to this. It's not a theoretical problem.
	- Step 1: Generate UUIDs using a highly predictable pattern
    - Step 2: Use the UUID as a security key - like saving a private file at files.example.com/12345678-1234-5678-1234-123456781234/private-file.pdf
