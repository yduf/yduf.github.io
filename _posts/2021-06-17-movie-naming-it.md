> We don’t want others. We want one name, and we want it fast, because it gives us our security back. We can say, “Here was the one man unlike the rest of us. We’ve named him, and he’s no more. And his reasons, they’re gone, too.” - [Arlington Road](https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/arlington-road-understood-that-the-conspiracy-cann/) / [imdb (7.2)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137363/)
