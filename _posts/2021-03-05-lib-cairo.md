> The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic Bézier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.) - [Home](https://www.cairographics.org/) / [github](https://github.com/freedesktop/cairo) / [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_(graphics))

	- It serves as the graphics engine for Google Chrome and Chrome OS, Android, Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS, and many other products. 
	- _We use both internally in our products. We find that Cairo is better documented and easier to compile and use, while Skia on the other hand is somewhat faster._ - [1](We use both internally in our products.

    - Cairo and Skia are for high performance 2D vector graphics.
