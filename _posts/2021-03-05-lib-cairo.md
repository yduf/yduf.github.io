The cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF. Operations in cairo including stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering. All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)

## [Text](https://cairographics.org/FAQ/#using_pango)

Fortunately, the pango library exists and does do sophisticated text layout, shaping, etc. and integrates very nicely with cairo. We heartily recommend that "real" applications wanting to display text with cairo use pango to do it.

## OpenGL / Vulkan

- [vkvg](https://github.com/jpbruyere/vkvg) - an open-source 2D graphics library written in C using Vulkan as backend. The API follows the same pattern as Cairo, but new functions and original drawing mechanics may be added.
