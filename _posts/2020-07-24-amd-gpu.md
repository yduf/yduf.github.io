> ROCm is focused on using AMD GPUs to accelerate computational tasks such as machine learning, engineering workloads, and scientific computing. - [github](https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm) / [Doc](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/index.html) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21855367)

### [Confirm You Have a ROCm-Capable GPU (v5.0)](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation_new.html)

- [ROCm officially supports AMD GPUs that use following chips:](https://community.amd.com/t5/knowledge-base/amd-rocm-hardware-and-software-support-document/ta-p/489937) 
	- **GFX8 GPUs** /  "Polaris 10" chips, such as on the AMD [Radeon RX 580](https://www.amazon.fr/s?k=rx580&__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&ref=nb_sb_noss_1)

### ROCm Installation
**Kernel** installation for GPU support
- [official guide](https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html)

Go with docker image (so that python/tensorflow version can be isolated)
- see [install Tensorflow]({% post_url 2020-09-06-tensorflow %})

# Alternatives
## [PlaidML](https://github.com/plaidml/plaidml)
> As a component under Keras, PlaidML can accelerate training workloads with customized or automatically-generated Tile code. It works especially well on GPUs, and it doesn't require use of CUDA/cuDNN on Nvidia hardware, while achieving comparable performance.
