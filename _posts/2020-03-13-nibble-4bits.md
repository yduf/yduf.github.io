> The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in packed decimal format (BCD) within an IBM mainframe. This technique is used to make computations faster and debugging easier. An 8-bit byte is split in half and each nibble is used to store one decimal digit. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibble)

Can be usefull for LUT as well.
