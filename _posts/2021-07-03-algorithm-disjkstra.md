> Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest-path problem is one of the most important graph algorithms... However, going from the pseudocode to an actual implementation is made difficult by the fact that it relies on a [priority queue]({% post_url 2021-07-03-cpp-priority-queue %}) with a "decrease key" operation... this operation is generally not supported. - [Actually Implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm](http://nmamano.com/blog/dijkstra/dijkstra.html)
