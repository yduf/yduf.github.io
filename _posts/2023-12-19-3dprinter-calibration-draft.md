PreRequesite
- a printer that is able to print something (first layer ok)

Next

There is 2 main factor that drive precision
- mechanics of the printer (squareness/flatness proper bed adhesion)
- material printed

- squareness - can be somewhat compensated by software (as well as flatness)

- Flow
Good results mandate a proper flow (which may depends on material being printed)
A Good flow
- will diminish elephant foot
- will give better surface finishing

It's difficult to evalute flow on first layer, since first layer heigth is also at play.

- dimension accurracy
This is link to horizontal expansion as well as material shrinkage.

- hole dimension
- this can be compensated by software.
