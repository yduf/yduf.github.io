## Defining the game

Let's assume we have a **Board** class which hold the state of current turn:
- all X/o
- player turn

from a Board instance **b**, we can ask for the available move to current player by calling metho **generateMove**

{% highlight cpp %}
auto v =  b.generateMove([&]( auto& moves) { ... } )
{% endhighlight %}

**generateMove** take a lambda as an argument and return the value returned when calling that lambda. The lambda itself must accept an array of possible actions as an argument.

We need an other method **play** that take a regular action and generate a new Board instance according to that move.

And finally **game_over** method tells if we reach the end of the game.

So in summary we have **Board** with the following interface:
- **generateMove**
- **play**
- **game_over**

## Random play

Using this, we can implement self random play:

{% highlight cpp %}
auto b = Board();

while( !b.game_over()) {
    b = b.generateMove([&]( auto& moves) { 
        return b.play( moves[ rand() % moves.size()]);
        });	
}
{% endhighlight %}

## MCTS algorithm 

Now let's do the same with a [Montecarlo Tree Search]().

We start with a first **Node** on a given **Board** instance (empty here),
and consider all possible moves for this position.

{% highlight cpp %}
int N = 10'000;
Board start;
Node<Board> mct( start);
auto best = mct.search([&]( int i) { return i < N; });
{% endhighlight %}
