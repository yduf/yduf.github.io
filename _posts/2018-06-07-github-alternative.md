If you want hosted Git, there are many competitors, but some of the notable are - Gitlab - Attlassian BitBucket - Google Cloud Repositories - Amazon CodeCommit - Canonical Launchpad - Sourceforge

All of which assume you want git, but other DVCSs are Mercurial (which is supported by a number of the above servers) and Fossil.
