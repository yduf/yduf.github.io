> The general usecase would be two machines standing next to each other, and you only want to have one keyboard and one mouse to use both of them, but do not want to rely on X11. - [superuser](https://superuser.com/questions/67659/linux-share-keyboard-over-network)

## [netevent](https://github.com/Blub/netevent/wiki/Share-devices-over-the-net) 
A tool which can be used to share linux event devices with other machines.
- [write-mode](https://github.com/Blub/netevent/wiki/Write-Mode) -  the program reads the device information, and the device events from stdin. It expects the data to be in the format generated by Read Mode. This mode uses the uinput special device to then create the same device again and passes the events it reads to the newly created device. This means that every event it reads from stdin will be executed by the device. It will act as if the device was physically connected to the new event device file.
- [Read Mode](https://github.com/Blub/netevent/wiki/Read-Mode) - 
the specified event device is opened. Its capabilities are dumped to stdout in a format that can be interpreted by Write Mode, and immediately after that, all events from the device will be dumped to stdout in binary as well. By default, the device is being grabbed, unless the -nograb option is added.
