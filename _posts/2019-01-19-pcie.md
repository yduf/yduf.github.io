> Peripheral Component Interconnect Express - [What is PCIe?](https://www.overclock.net/forum/355-ssd/1489684-ssd-interface-comparison-pci-express-vs-sata.html)

Peripheral Component Interconnect Express, or PCIe, is a physical interconnect for motherboard expansion. Normally this is the connector slot you plug your graphics card, network card, sound card, or for storage purposes, a RAID card into. PCIe was designed to replace the older PCI, PCI-X, and AGP bus standards and to allow for more flexibility for expansion. Improvements include higher maximum bandwidth, lower I/O pin count and smaller physical footprint, better performance-scaling, more detailed error detection and reporting, and hot-plugging. The physical connector on the motherboard typically allows for up to 16 lanes for data transfer. A PCIe device that is an x4 device can fit into a PCIe x4 slot up to an x16 slot and still function. PCIe 1.0 allowed for 250MB/s per lane, PCIe 2.0 allows for 500MB/s per lane and the newest PCIe 3.0 allows for 1GB/s per lane.


### PCI-Express Speeds

|---------|--------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| PCIe 1.0 | 250 MB/s | 500 MB/s | 750 MB/s | 2 GB/s | 4 GB/s |
| PCIe 2.0 | 500 MB/s | 1000 MB/s | 2 GB/s | 4 GB/s | 8 GB/s |
| PCIe 3.0 | 1 GB/s | 2 GB/s | 4 GB/s | 8 GB/s | 16 GB/s |
| PCIe 4.0 | 2 GB/s | 4 GB/s | 8 GB/s | 16 GB/s | 32 GB/s |
| PCIe 5.0 | 4 GB/s | 8 GB/s | 16 GB/s | 32 GB/s | 63 GB/s |
| PCIe 6.0 | 8 GB/s | 15 GB/s | 30 GB/s | 61 GB/s | 121 GB/s |
| PCIe 7.0 | 15 GB/s | 30 GB/s | 61 GB/s | 121 GB/s | 242 GB/s |
