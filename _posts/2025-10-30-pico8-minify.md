> [Shrinko8](https://github.com/thisismypassport/shrinko8?tab=readme-ov-file#shrinko8) - an aggressive cart minifier (+ linter & other tools) - [online](https://thisismypassport.github.io/shrinko8/)

### [Compression limit](http://pico8wiki.com/index.php?title=Save#The_.p8.png_format,_and_the_compressed_code_size_limit)
Because there is a small, fixed amount of space available to encode the cart in the image, PICO-8 uses compression to reduce the size of the cart's source code. The compressed code size must be under a certain limit for the save to succeed. As of 0.2.2c, this limit is 15,616 bytes.
