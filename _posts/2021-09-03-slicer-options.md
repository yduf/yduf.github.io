- check printer settings
- Remove Build Plate Adhesion (Skirt, Brim, Raft)
- Edit the Cura Definitions Within the File ? to suppress machine_disallowed_area

### Layer height
Recommanded:  
0.08, 0.12, 0.16, 0.20, 0.24, 0.28, 0.32 (for 0.4 nozzle)

### [Line Width](https://3dprinterly.com/how-to-get-the-perfect-line-width-setting/)

Many slicers default the line width to between 100% and 120% of the nozzle diameter. Increasing line width is great for increasing part strength, while decreasing line width can improve printing times, as well as print quality. The minimum and maximum is around 60% and 200% of the nozzle diameter.

## Quality

- [print one part at a time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Z02BowhQwU)
	- [turn on combing mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnV71HYIEw) - force ravel inside parts
    	- it may reduce print time as well
- multi part
	- special mode (one part at time)
    - orient part to side way to have unseen side oppose to each other
- [smoother surface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkAqTWmVRVA)
- [removing blob artefacts ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hvw3DrVAeTA) - due to pressure
	- use resolution setting => reduce the size of gcode file by merging point
    	- maximum resolution = 0.5 ( or 1.1333)
        - maximum traveil resolution = 0.7
        - maximum deviation 0.05 (or 0.075)

- [Elephant Foot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlgR3rHg4p8), possible solution
	- use a very small chanfer to compensate in CAD
    - use slicer compensation for first layer
		- Cura - Initial Layer Horizontal Expansion
    - use a RAFT

### Hidding default

- using [fuzzy skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0uXhN3CffQ)

### Seam removal
- [move seam to corner](https://youtu.be/NU1kYEE3qrQ?t=114)
	- wall / Z seam alignment
- [vase mode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJXIqdJpkuI)

### Printer Precision / Holes
- [Dimensional Accuracy](https://www.simplify3d.com/support/print-quality-troubleshooting/dimensional-accuracy/)
	- First Layer Impact - verify that your measurements are not being affected by the first layer position.
    - **Under or Over-Extrusion** - If the extrusion multiplier is too low, you may start to see gaps between perimeters, holes in your top surfaces, and parts that are smaller than their intended size. If your extrusion multiplier is too high, you may notice top layers that tend to bulge upwards and parts that are larger than intended.
    - **Constant Dimensional Error** - => horizontal expansion
    - **Increasing Dimensional Error** -  then it is likely the problem may be due to thermal contraction.
- [Horizontal expansion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jsBI3OeUJQ) 
	- [Cura Horizontal Expansion â€“ A Better Way of Calibrating](https://the3dprinterbee.com/cura-horizontal-expansion/)
    	- **Horizontal Expansion vs. Flow Rate** - The difference between the flow rate and the horizontal expansion is that the dimensions of the object do not change when the flow rate is changed in the slicer. Changing the flow rate does not compensate well for inaccuracies. 
        - **Horizontal Expansion vs. Shrinkage Compensation** - Horizontal expansion in Cura expands each point of the object by a value in mm. Shrinkage compensation scales the object by a percentage value. The end result is therefore fundamentally different and suitable for different applications.

    - middle - for others for best accuracy
    - exclusive - for part that needs to fit together
