## [CORS - Why Is It Needed?](https://auth0.com/blog/cors-tutorial-a-guide-to-cross-origin-resource-sharing/)

Most of the time, a script running in the user's browser would only ever need to access resources on the same origin (think about API calls to the same backend that served the JavaScript code in the first place). So the fact that JavaScript can't normally access resources on other origins is a good thing for security.

In this context, "other origins" means the URL being accessed differs from the location that the JavaScript is running from, by having:

- a different scheme (HTTP or HTTPS)
- a different domain
- a different port

However, there are legitimate scenarios where cross-origin access is desirable or even necessary. For example, if you're running a React SPA that makes calls to an API backend running on a different domain. Web fonts also rely on CORS to work.
