> An alternative option is to use an "open-loop" variant of MCTS. Your nodes would no longer represent game states, but only be representative of the sequence of actions leading to them. You would no longer store any game states in any nodes, but always regenerate them from scratch when traversing the tree, starting from the root node. - [MCTS for stochastic environment?](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/22914/how-to-run-a-monte-carlo-tree-search-mcts-for-stochastic-environment)
