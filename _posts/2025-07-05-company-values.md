### Establishing your company values

1. Get a facilitator to run an offsite workshop
1. Write down these five words
	- Integrity
    - Respect
    - Innovation
    - Collaboration
    - Excellence
1. Put them in a hat
1. Pick out five

Then put them out on the value page of your webpage.

Do you do the values?
Of course not, you put them on the webpages. And point people to the value page,
and everything will be ok.

If the values would reflect reality, the values of Boeing would be _not quite enougth bolt_.
