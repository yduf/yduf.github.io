They encrypted the motors as DRM. Not all companies do that. DRMs restrict everything you do with your device. It is illegal to circumvent unless there’s an active 3-year exemption for it and the use case. Exemptions are at: [https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-28/pdf/2021-23311.pdf](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2021-10-28/pdf/2021-23311.pdf)

Making sure you can only use it with design space is DRM. It is hard to use a Cricut without Design Space.

Design Space is mostly online.

You have to log in to use your Cricut

DRM is defective by design. [https://www.defectivebydesign.org/](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/)

I use a Silhouette Cameo 4 with no DRM(software I use is InkCut with modifications)

**It is needed to control the printer**

But Design can be made outside of it and imported as SVG
