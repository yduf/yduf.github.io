> Whether you rewrite or refactor, the lesson is the same: You have to grind your way into the good architecture. It doesn't become good because the code is fresh, but because you have battle scars to show. And a success story in that case comes from having a complete learning loop. In a lot of orgs the learning itself is argued against for one reason or another - development proceeds with as little feedback on quality as can be gotten away with.  - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23397240)
