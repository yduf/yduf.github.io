- The probability that a certain person be stupid is independent of any other characteristic of that person.
- A stupid person is a person who causes losses to another person or to a group of persons while himself deriving no gain and even possibly incurring losses.

- A stupid person is the most dangerous type of person.
- A stupid person is more dangerous than a bandit.
