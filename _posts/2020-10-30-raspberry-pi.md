	- **ttyAMA0** is the device for the first serial port on ARM architecture. ttyAMA0 can be the Tx, Rx pins for the Raspberry. But for the [*Raspberry Pi 3b*](ttyAMA0 can be the Tx, Rx pins for the Raspberry. But for the Raspberry Pi 3b it was used for the Bluetooth.) it was used for the **Bluetooth**.
