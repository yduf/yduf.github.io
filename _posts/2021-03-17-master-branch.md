> Personally, I have no attachment to any of these words. I just don’t appreciate the idea that we as software engineers can now sit back and believe we’ve made some kind of positive change, coz we haven’t. I’m not pissed off because I expected tech companies to do more, no, I didn’t expect them to do anything. I’m pissed off because they pretended to be doing good and wanted me to congratulate them for it. - [GitHub, f ck your name change](https://mooseyanon.medium.com/github-f-ck-your-name-change-de599033bbbe) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26487854)
