### Entity Component System (ECS)
- the opposite of a fat-struct
- Architecture care about encapsulation boundaries
	- where you make it difficult to access things
    - vs where you make it easy
- Encapsulation boundaries around the system vs Boundaries accross the objects
- don't make the domain model be in the code.
	- compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model
