### Entity Component System (ECS)
- the opposite of a fat-struct
- Architecture care about encapsulation boundaries
	- where you make it difficult to access things
    - vs where you make it easy
- Encapsulation boundaries around the system vs Boundaries accross the objects
- don't make the domain model be in the code.
	- compile-time hierarchy of encapsulation that matches the domain model

### OOP
- oop was just about passing message - (Alan Kay)
- inheritance hierarchy was told early (since 1980s)
	- C++ does not force to do it that way (even if it promoted it a  lot)
- Stroustrup 1994 (Design of Evolution of C++) - C++ on simula -> didn't scale 
	- Simula build was very long / incremental build suck
    - Simula runtime was very slow (because of the GC even when no work was needed)
    - about large Teams (were hierarchy and encapsulation should strive) => didn't work even on 1 people team
    - inheritance used mainly for code-reuse
	- INSPECT from simula was explicitly not ported to C++ 
    	- forcing latter usage of virtual function (vs discriminated union)
- Team Fat Struct Founded 1960
	- Dougals T. Ross (struct(plex) + vtable)
- Ivan Sutherland's SketchPad (1963) - probably the most significant thesis ever done - Alan Kay (1987)
	- [ring structured](https://youtu.be/wo84LFzx5nI?si=LtKJzwD9d2dtB_4y&t=5614) designed to rapid constraint satisfaction
    	- chicken - a link in the linked list that point to the sentinel (hen)
	- the virtual function was the least interessting part of this (because it was possible because draw was very simple)
- CSG on Spheres (1997) - NegaMan (Negative Metaball)
