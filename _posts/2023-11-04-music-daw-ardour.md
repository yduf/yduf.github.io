### Toolkit

As Ardour is used in conjunction with other tool, it may be usefull to use a pipewire session manager like [RaySession](http://raysession.tuxfamily.org/en/index.html) to memorize settings.

A session manager is like a patchbay (like [Helvum](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/helvum)) adding the ability to run and save several programs together.
