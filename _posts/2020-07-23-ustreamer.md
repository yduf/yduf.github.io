title: Stream MJPG Video (µStreamer)
tags: video streaming raspberry-pi webcam

> [µStreamer](https://github.com/pikvm/ustreamer) is a lightweight and very quick server to broadcast MJPG video from any V4L2 device to the net. 

µStreamer is very similar to mjpg-streamer with input_uvc.so and output_http.so plugins, however, there are some major differences. **TL;DR**

All new browsers have native support of this video format, as well as most video players such as mplayer, VLC etc. µStreamer is a part of the Pi-KVM project designed to stream VGA and HDMI screencast hardware data with the highest resolution and FPS possible.

If you're going to live-stream from your backyard webcam and need to control it, use mjpg-streamer. If you need a high-quality image with high FPS - µStreamer for the win.
