This 1700s painting is called the Nude Maja by Francisco Goya. It was a private commission that was never supposed to see the light of day. A painting that was hidden behind closed doors for over a decade. A painting that was confiscated by authorities and almost led to Goya’s arrest! A few years later, Goya created The Clothed Maja. Her pose and expression is almost identical to her counterpart. Although we aren’t sure of the identity of the person who commissioned this piece, all signs point to Manuel de Godoy, the first secretary of State of Spain, appointed by King Charles IV. While the model's identity remains a mystery, she’s believed to be either the Duchess of Alba, Goya’s rumored mistress or Pepita Tudó, Manuel de Godoy’s mistress. The paintings were confiscated from Godoy’s collection by Napoleon Bonaparte’s forces when the French occupied Spain during the Peninsular War. They were then confiscated by the Spanish Inquisition once Ferdinand VII returned to power.
