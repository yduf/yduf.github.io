> demonstrate how easy it is to solder very small electronic SMD (surface mount device) components on your PCB board. It is easier to work with compared to through-hole components. The component insertion time is shorter, and there are no componentâ€™s leads to cut away after the soldering. This save time and cost. - [DIY Surface Mount Soldering and PCB Assembly](http://www.pic-control.com/diy-surface-mount-soldering-and-pcb-assembly/)
