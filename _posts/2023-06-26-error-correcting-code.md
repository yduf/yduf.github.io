> Until the discovery of better coding techniques ([Turbo codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_code) and [low-density parity codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-density_parity-check_code)), Reed-Solomon forward error correction (FEC) was one of the most powerful ways to make data storage or data transmission resilient against corruption - [Reed-Solomon Error Correcting Codes from the Bottom Up](https://tomverbeure.github.io/2022/08/07/Reed-Solomon.html)
