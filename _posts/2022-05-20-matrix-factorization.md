> Six matrix factorizations dominate in numerical linear algebra and matrix analysis: for most purposes one of them is sufficient for the task at hand. - [The Big Six Matrix Factorizations](https://nhigham.com/2022/05/18/the-big-six-matrix-factorizations/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31421745)

**Cholesky Factorization** - solving positive definite linear systems.

**LU Factorization** - solving general linear systems.

**QR Factorization** - solving least squares problems, computing an orthonormal basis for the range space of A, orthogonalization.

**Schur Decomposition** - computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors, computing invariant subspaces, evaluating matrix functions.

**Spectral Decomposition** - any problem involving eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices.

**Singular Value Decomposition** - determining matrix rank, solving rank-deficient least squares problems, computing all kinds of subspace information.
