> it's very simple, i struggled with this issue using Ubuntu and Ubuntu flavored distros for years (Mint, Elementary OS, etc). Go back into bios, have usb 3.0 turned on, an any other options turned on, but turn off legacy usb option - [How do I get usb 3.0 driver working](https://askubuntu.com/questions/729558/how-do-i-get-usb-3-0-driver-working-or-check-that-it-is-already-working)

## ̀lsusb -tv / usbview

- [why doesn't lsusb list a device](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/416562/why-doesnt-lsusb-list-a-device) - `lsusb` vs [`sudo usb-devices`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/usb-devices) vs `hwinfo --usb`

`lsusb`, when it’s listing devices in its default short view, only displays the manufacturer and product information it finds in `/var/lib/usbutils/usb.ids`, and not the information supplied by each device.
