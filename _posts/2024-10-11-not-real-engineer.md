> You are not a real engineer... - [poem](https://twitchard.github.io/posts/2019-05-29-not-a-real-engineer.html)

>You are a creature with a terrible countenance  
the stature of a man  
and the head of a lion  
with sixteen wings about you  
white as fresh snow  
hundreds of eyes  
that flicker like torches  
and dart in all directions  
the belt at your waist is a serpent  
your breath is the gathering of stormclouds  
your voice is the roar of the wind  
the grass withers before your footsteps  
and your writhing, ponderous tongue  
black as the abyss  
brings apocalypse upon everything it touches  
>
> We regret to inform you  
we will not be offering you the role at this time –  
we’re looking for somebody more technical
