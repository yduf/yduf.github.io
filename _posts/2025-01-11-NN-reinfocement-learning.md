> a high-level framework for solving sequential decision-making problems. An RL agent navigates an environment by taking actions based on some observations, receiving rewards as a result. Most RL algorithms work by maximizing the expected total rewards an agent collects in a trajectory, e.g., during one in-game round. - [Deep Reinforcement Learning With TensorFlow 2.1](http://inoryy.com/post/tensorflow2-deep-reinforcement-learning/)
