### Simple Viewer

- [Xviewer (linux mint default)](https://github.com/linuxmint/xviewer)
	- forked from [Eye of gnome 3.14](https://projects-old.gnome.org/eog/)
    - Does not [support JPEG XL (yet)](https://github.com/linuxmint/xviewer/issues/162)
    
### Simple Editor
- Pinta: paint style
- [Pix](https://github.com/linuxmint/pix#pix) - very similar to gThumb - JXL support is blocky as of v3.0.2
- [gThumb](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gthumb/#gthumb): crop, rotate
