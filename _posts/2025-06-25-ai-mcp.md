> a lot of folks are assuming the primary users of mcp are the end users connecting their claude/vscode/etc to whatever saas platform they're working on. While this _is_ a huge benefit and super cool to use, imo the main benefit is for things like giving complex tool access to centralized agents. Where the mcp servers allow you to build agents that have the tools to do a sort of "custom deep research." - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44338793)

 	- MCP will throttle production traffic (in case its overload)
    - MCP is not a data retrieval mechanism (no SQL)
    - security theater - need to think about security first
    - magical performance - external information introduce noise to internal workflowss and can degrade overall performance
    - MCP per microservice - latency / security / audit

- MCP excels at:
	- for internal analysis
    - bridging complex workflow accross system
    - summarizing things
