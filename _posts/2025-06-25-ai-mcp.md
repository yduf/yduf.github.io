 	- MCP will throttle production traffic (in case its overload)
    - MCP is not a data retrieval mechanism (no SQL)
    - security theater - need to think about security first
    - magical performance - external information introduce noise to internal workflowss and can degrade overall performance
    - MCP per microservice - latency / security / audit

- MCP excels at:
	- for internal analysis
    - bridging complex workflow accross system
    - summarizing things
