### Cons
- Need to install Android/iOS App + create an account
- Setup can only be done through the App
	- one account at the tapo level for global setting
    - one account on the device to create a user/password and enable the RTSP feed.
    	- high quality `rtsp://user:password/IP Address/stream1`
    	- low  quality `rtsp://user:password/IP Address/stream2`
### Pro
- once setup / rstp is functional
