### Cons
- Need to install Android/iOS App + create an account
- Setup can only be done through the App
	- one account at the tapo level for global setting
    - [a second configuration](https://www.tapo.com/en/faq/34/) from the app to create a user/password and enable the RTSP feed for the device.
    	- high quality `rtsp://user:password/IP Address/stream1`
    	- low  quality `rtsp://user:password/IP Address/stream2`
	- RSTP is not enabled when a SDCard is present
### Pro
- once setup / rstp is functional and can be accessed by ffplay (for eg).
- seems to be supported by [iSpy](https://github.com/ispysoftware/iSpy)
