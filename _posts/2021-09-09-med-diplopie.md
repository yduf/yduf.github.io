> Diplopia can also occur when viewing with only one eye...  multiple image perception includes the consideration of such conditions as ... diffraction-based (rather than geometrical) optical models have shown that common optical conditions, especially astigmatism, can also produce this symptom. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplopia#Monocular)

Monocular diplopia may be induced in many individuals, even those with normal eyesight, with simple defocusing experiments involving fine, high-contrast lines.

In this sense, double vision is neither dangerous nor harmful, and may even be enjoyable. It makes viewing stereograms possible.
