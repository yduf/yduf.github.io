> This GIF shows a side-by-side clean build of the Apache Commons Lang library using Maven and Gradle (without build cache). You can view [the build scan for this build here](https://scans.gradle.com/s/of466wbcmynxm). - [Maven vs Gradle](https://gradle.org/maven-vs-gradle/)

### Gradle vs Maven / Groovy vs Java
> To do anything you have to know everything - [The Problem with Gradle](https://www.bruceeckel.com/2021/01/02/the-problem-with-gradle/)

> The correct response to discovering the nature of Gradle is to abandon it, immediately. (Similarly Waf, and Scons.) The world does not need yet another one-or-two-language-target build system, or another build system as full general scripting language. Things work better when you don't need expertise. A build system should be just barely powerful enough to do builds, but not powerful enough to mystify. A build system should work equally well for all the languages you might find you need to use. A build system should not need to be studied to be understood: isolated examples should suffice for each need. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25803178)

## [Migrating from Maven to Gradle](https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-from-maven/)

- Gradle does not support BOMs directly, but you can make use of them in your Gradle build files by applying the nebula-dependency-recommender-plugin.

### [Common plugins](https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-from-maven/#common_plugins)
Maven and Gradle share a common approach of extending the build through plugins. Although the plugin systems are very different beneath the surface, they share many feature-based plugins, such as:
   - Shade/Shadow
   - Jetty
   - Checkstyle
   - JaCoCo
   - AntRun (see further down)

### [Plugins you don’t need](https://guides.gradle.org/migrating-from-maven/#plugins_you_don_t_need)

It’s worth remembering that Gradle builds are typically easier to extend and customize than Maven. In this context, that means you may not need a Gradle plugin to replace a Maven one. For example, the Maven Enforcer plugin allows you to control dependency versions and environmental factors, but these things can easily be configured in a normal Gradle build script.

## [Gradle Build Language Reference](https://docs.gradle.org/4.5.1/dsl/)
A build script is also a Groovy script, and so can contain those elements allowed in a Groovy script, such as method definitions and class definitions.
