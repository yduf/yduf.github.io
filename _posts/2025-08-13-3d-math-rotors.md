> 3D Rotors are in a sense the true form of quaternions, or in other words Quaternions are an obfuscated version of Rotors. - [A practical introduction for 3D graphics (2023)](https://jacquesheunis.com/post/rotors/) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43234510)

Rotors like [quaternions]({% post_url 2018-09-07-quaternion %}) also require 4 dimensions to represent 3d rotations, they're just labeled slightly more intuitively. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43268272):

- **quaterions**: $ 0*1 + b*i + c*j + d*k $  
- **rotors**:  $ 0*1 + b*xy + c*yz + d*zx $
