1. Never fire the laser with the cover open.
1. Never operate the laser without the water pump functioning, and proper ventilation.
1. Never look at the laser directly. Reflections from the laser can permanently blind you. Even reflections off of a wall or material being cut can be incredibly dangerous.
1. Never leave the operating laser unattended.
1. Have a fire extinguisher on hand, and be able to kill power to the unit immediately in case of emergency.
