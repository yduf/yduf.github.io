> - the surface of a sphere is the same as it's projection on a containing cylinder.
> - it's equal to 4 times it's shadow.
> - a rectangle on the sphere and it's projection on the cylinder account for the same surface. 
> - the surface area for a sphere (4.pi.R²) is just the derivative of its volume (4/3.pi.R³).
> - the perimeter of a circle (2.pi.R) is the derivative of its area (pi.R²).
(this should be obvious a fundamental calculus)
