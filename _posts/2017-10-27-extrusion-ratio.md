### [Tuning Material Flow For Best Quality 3d Prints ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W901s6zTwiw)
- extruder calibration
- calibration flow test


A very [simple and fast print test](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1622868) for configuring a 3d printer extrusion ratio. 

see also [the calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11wnlCU2EVHg3Nl7GxisAegoGicogK_QTkMjRavwx0ME/edit#gid=0)

On Cura the extrusion ratio can be found in Material.flow.
- using _Materials plugins_ the Material flow, can be stored be material config (as well as other parameters).
