> When we're at the stage when something that can be implemented in a weekend is described as "a doctoral research project", and then I am accused of "impugning the reader" for describing something as simple that is extremely simple, we're done. Consider the bug report closed. - [Windows Term Extremely slow performance (Casey Muratori)](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/10362) / [It takes a PhD to develop that](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28743687) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27775268)

The "complaining developer" produced a proof of concept in just two weekends that notably had more features[1] and was more correct than the Windows Terminal!
