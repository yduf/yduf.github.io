> A youth named Guybrush Threepwood arrives on the fictional Mêlée Island, with the desire to become a pirate. He seeks out the island's pirate leaders, who set him three trials that must be completed to become a pirate: winning a sword duel against Carla, the island's resident swordmaster, finding a buried treasure, and stealing a valuable idol from the governor's mansion. - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secret_of_Monkey_Island)

	- using multi 5 script, for playing needs to:

## The Curse of Monkey Island

![caption](https://lutris.net/games/banner/the-curse-of-monkey-island.jpg) <!-- .element height="50%" width="50% ustify-content="left" -->

Install on Linux
- install directly with native wine integration / [Lutris](https://lutris.net/games/the-curse-of-monkey-island/)

In the end we can see that this game rely on scummvm, which is unpacked alongside with the game
=> so on linux one can directly run the native and latest [scummvm](https://www.scummvm.org/downloads/#current)
- `Ctrl-F5` - give access to ScummVM global menu (in-game)
- `F5` - game menu
- `Alt-Return` - toggle full-screen
- `Ctrl-Alt-0` - next-scaler
- `Ctrl-Alt-9` - prev-scaler
    
Playing on touchpad is difficult:
- didn't find a way to have long press on mouse-1 to display the floating action menu, as a workaround, pressing:
	- 'T' - talk
    - 'E' - examine
    - 'U' - use / pick
- using mouse work's fine
	- left button - action menu
    - right button - inventory
