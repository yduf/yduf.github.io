### Atlernatives
- [DaVinci Resolve 18](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/whatsnew) / [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31142560) - For a small 30-second clip I like the more approachable, simple workflow of Kdenlive but holiday videos with a hundred or more cuts work much better with Davinci for me.
