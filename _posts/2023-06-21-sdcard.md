In case you chose an SD card that was already in use before please consider resetting it back to ‘factory default’ performance with [SD Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) before burning ([explanation in the forum](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/3776-the-partition-is-not-resized-to-full-sd-card-size/)).
