In case you chose an SD card that was already in use before please consider resetting it back to ‘factory default’ performance with [SD Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/) before burning ([explanation in the forum](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/3776-the-partition-is-not-resized-to-full-sd-card-size/)). 

Write the xz compressed image with USBImager or balenaEtcher on all platforms since unlike other tools, either can validate burning results saving you from corrupted SD card contents.

Also important: Most SD cards are only optimised for sequential reads/writes as it is common with digital cameras. This is what the speed class is about. The SD Association defined Application Performance Class as a standard for random IO performance.
