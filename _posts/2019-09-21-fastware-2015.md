> Have a good baseline! - code::dive / Fastware 2015 - [Andrei](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrfYLlR8X8k)

- [Amdahl’s law]({% post_url 2018-09-07-Amdahl %})
- optimize outside / profile again within the application
- doNotOptimizeAway()

- Baselines - **have a good baseline**
	- beware of baseline x2 (cache/alloc memory)
    - don't do sequencing comparison
    - beware of data pattern
- [facebook/folly]({% post_url 2019-09-21-bench-code %}) code

- Prefer to use:
	- Prefer `a[i++]` to `a[++i]` - less data dependency / better hardware usage / better parrallelisation. 
    - minimize jump (keep flow)
    - keep pattern access (prefetching)
    - The hotest place on earth is the stack.
    - Globals are bad, because they pessimize everything for the compiler.

## [followup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tvbz8CSI8M)
- many ALU permit instruction level parallelism
    - to use them have fewer data dependencies
		- eg String to int
