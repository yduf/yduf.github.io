> oxygen polarize sunlight - [An Optical Navigation System Better Than GPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ERqAqwQ1wo)

- sun make oxygen atom electon oscilate
	- they behave then as oscilator themself
    - the sky act as a polarizer
    - the process is call raylight scattering
    - if there was no oxygen, the sky would look black like on the moon.
- that's also why the sky is blue
- insect like bees have eyes that behave an optical compass (relative to the sun position)
