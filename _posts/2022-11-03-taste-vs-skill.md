Mediocre directors, in turn, might know exactly how to shoot scenes, but have no taste for making good ones. -  [Taste and Skills](https://refactoring.fm/p/taste-vs-skills)

If great taste is knowing what’s good, and great skill is knowing how to build things, there is a third element that I have consistently found in the most experienced people I have known.

They do not only know what is good — they also know exactly why.

They know what makes good things good.

Which is less trivial than it seems.
