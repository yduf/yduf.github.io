- Minimum layer height: 25% of nozzle size For a 0.60mm nozzle, this is 0.15mm.
- Maximum layer height: 80% of nozzle size. For 0.60mm nozzle, this is 0.48mm

- Maximum extrusion width: 120% of nozzle size.

### Visible seam

	- It is Cura's fault. Tweak z-seam option in Cura and check the planned path for the spiral object. 
    - one solution is to increase acceleration and jerk settings on the firmware because now the print head doesn't spend so much time at the corner.  The other solution is to lower print speed such that, again, the normal speed and corner speed are about the same.

	- remove the silicon socks
    - around 130C for PLA and 150C for PETG, remove the filament with a quick pull in order to avoid filament clogs. This is not exactly a cold pull, but it will help you to remove most of the filament. This makes the nozzle change process easier.
    - unscrew a bit the head (when possible)
    - then unscrew the nozzle
    
> Then change extruder printer.cfg in klipper, as well as in Cura.
> ** recalibrate probe after change**
