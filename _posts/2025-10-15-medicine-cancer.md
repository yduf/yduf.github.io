- [	Ultrasound is ushering a new era of surgery-free cancer treatment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45514378) - Proton therapy offers incremental, if any advantage, over standard IMRT for non-pediatric cases. In the case of the prostate, recent evidence shows no benefit at all. It suffers from near hyperbolic marketing from debt-ridden therapy centers pushing dubious claims that are now being exposed by high quality phase III comparison trials.

HIFU for prostate also is a ripe area for grifters as it is advertised and marketed towards low risk cases that would probably benefit from active surveillance.
