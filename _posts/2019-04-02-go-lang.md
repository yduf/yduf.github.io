> our programmers are Googlers, they’re not researchers. They’re typically, fairly young, fresh out of school, probably learned Java, maybe learned C or C++, probably learned Python. They’re not capable of understanding a brilliant language but we want to use them to build good software. So, the language that we give them has to be easy for them to understand and easy to adopt. – [Rob Pike 1](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16143918)

> GO syntax is very regressive comparing to where we hopped programming languages should go.
I believe GO success is partly because in recent years, we have many new specialized engineers that programming isn’t their main focus (DevOps, Data Scientists, SREs) and naturally they are looking for tooling with shorter learning curve. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21223242)

> ... **Both of these decisions**, in major modern languages, solve certain classes of problems—and both **pay a price for their choices.** Go’s error handling has become a meme, for example. Articles to help with understanding lifetimes in Rust are nearly as ubiquitous as monad tutorials for the aspiring Haskeller, and it turns out that a lot of important data structures are pretty hard to implement when you have to worry about them. Still, you can’t say that either language has failed in its goals—it’s just that each has chosen different tradeoffs. **In other words: every decision made in order to simplify a program will cost something.** - [The Danger of “Simplicity”](https://asthasr.github.io/posts/danger-of-simplicity/) - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21604710)
