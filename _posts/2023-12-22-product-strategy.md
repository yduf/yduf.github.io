> "Build it and they will come" is almost never a winning strategy. Of course sometimes it works, you build the right thing at the right time and it goes viral, but most of the time you get crickets even if it gets to the top of Product Hunt or Hacker News (neither of which are of any importance outside of tech circles).

This is difficult if you don't have a network or experience in specific industries so tech people just wait around for a business person to tell them what to build instead. - [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38711075)
